"""The repo-config half of #558: the committed settings that give each session its own browser.

`@playwright/mcp` derives its on-disk profile as `mcp-<channel>-<sha256(first MCP root)[:7]>`,
so DIFFERENT repositories never collide by construction. The residual is two `claude` sessions
with the SAME workspace root: one profile, and the second browser refuses to start at all
(`Browser is already in use … use --isolated`). The remedy is one committed line — the env
equivalent of that flag, in this repo's `.claude/settings.json`.

What makes it worth a test is HOW it fails. Every part of this fix is silent when it breaks:

* the VALUE is parsed by playwright-core's `envToBoolean`, which accepts only `"true"` and
  `"1"`; `"yes"` is not "truthy", it is IGNORED — the key is still there, the browser is not
  isolated, and nothing anywhere says so.
* the file only reaches clones and NEW WORKTREES (where the per-task agents of the parallel
  drain live) if git carries it. `.gitignore` hides `.claude/*` and re-includes exactly this
  one path; drop the `!` line and the fix evaporates with no other signal — the file keeps
  sitting in the author's checkout, working, for them alone.

So the pins here are deliberately not "the key is present": they hold the value against the
set that actually flips the flag, and they ask GIT — not a grep — whether the file survives
the ignore rules. The rulebook half of the same card (the `Граница правила` bullet that tells
an agent what to do when it meets this in someone else's project) is pinned next door, in
tests/unit/test_skill_contract.py, which is the module that owns SKILL.md.

#585 added the other half of the same subject: the tests that hold what is deliberately NOT
configured. Its proposal — `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_STORAGE_STATE`, upstream's documented complement to
`--isolated` — was measured, composes, and still does not ship, because the file it points at
is LIVE SESSION COOKIES and this repo is PUBLIC. So the pins below run the other way round:
that the committed settings never carry such a path, and that such a file does not reach git.

That second half is deliberately TWO guards of different kinds, because a name-based one
cannot do the job alone — and claiming it could was this card's own first defect, caught in
review by CONSTRUCTING the leak it did not cover. `browser_storage_state` accepts any filename
anywhere under its root, so `.gitignore` can only exclude a LIST of names. Hence FOUR directions
are pinned, one per thing the prose claims: `COVERED_NAMES` are excluded, `UNCOVERED_NAMES` are
NOT, `COLLATERAL_NAMES` are what the rules cost in ordinary files, and `CASE_VARIANT_NAMES` hold
that the list is a different list on Linux than on macOS. Each sentence describing the guard is
falsifiable against it, so none can quietly drift into promising more than it does again. The
guarantee that does NOT depend on the name is
`test_no_file_of_storage_state_shape_is_reachable_by_git`, which asks git what `git add -A`
would publish and reads each candidate's SHAPE — at any size, since a candidate too large to
read is reported rather than skipped (see `SHAPE_SCAN_MAX_BYTES`, whose first version made the
guard evadable by making the file bigger).

#629 is the same two-layer answer applied to the hole beside #607's directory rule. That rule
covers what the browser names ITSELF; a `filename` argument is resolved against the SERVER's cwd,
so it lands in the main checkout's ROOT and nothing excluded it. Layer one is four extension
rules; layer two is `test_no_file_of_browser_artifact_shape_is_reachable_by_git`, which reads
leading MAGIC BYTES because — measured — the extension does not decide the content at all: a
screenshot asked for as `shot.bin`, or with no extension, is still PNG. Layer two is complete
about NAMES, not about FORMATS: `tools/list` showed SEVEN tools taking a `filename` on the default
capability set, and one of them, `browser_network_request`, writes a raw response body of ANY
format (a GIF and a ZIP, constructed). What neither layer reaches is pinned too — the four that
write TEXT (snapshot, console, network, evaluate) drop the page's own text in the same root under
names and in formats no rule can tell from a legitimate file.

It is a gate, not a lock: it turns a leak red in the pre-push run this repo's integration
recipe already requires and in CI; it cannot stop a `git commit`. Nothing here can, and the two
mechanisms that look like they could were built rather than argued about. A `.git/hooks`
pre-commit hook is not carried by a clone at all. The obvious answer to that — commit the hooks
and point `core.hooksPath` at them — was constructed: origin with `.githooks/pre-commit` (exit
1) plus `core.hooksPath=.githooks` blocks its own commit; in a fresh clone the DIRECTORY arrives
and `core.hooksPath` does NOT (it is local config, not content), and the clone's commit went
through unblocked. Those two measurements generalise without needing a third: a hook manager can
only put its trigger in a file under `.git/` or in a local config key, and neither is content, so
every "stronger" option reduces to "works on whichever machine ran an installer" — which is
precisely the "correct on the author's disk and reaching nobody" failure the settings-delivery
pin below was written after being bitten by.

Most of that asks GIT a question, so most of this file needs a git checkout to mean anything at
all — see `requires_git_checkout` below for what happens in a tree that is not one, and why the
answer is a skip rather than the 30 red tests it used to be.

#
# Names the extension rules are claimed to cover. The first two are the two spellings SKILL.md
# itself prints, and they belong to DIFFERENT procedures — a distinction the first draft of this
# comment lost. `shot-554.png` is the `npx playwright screenshot` one-liner, which SKILL.md has
# measured as landing in the AGENT's own worktree (a linked worktree carries this same .gitignore,

# browser_console_messages / browser_network_requests / browser_evaluate all dropped one in the
# root too, carrying the page's text and request query strings — a marker planted on the probe

#
# The residual #629 measured and left open on purpose: the four tools that write the page's own
# TEXT (browser_snapshot / browser_console_messages / browser_network_requests /
# browser_evaluate). Neither layer above can reach them — the names measured were `.md`, `.txt`,
# `.json` and one with no extension, which is what this repo's own content looks like, and plain
# text has no leading signature to match. So #703 fixes it at the WRITE SITE instead: SKILL.md
# stops printing a bare name and prints a path under `.playwright-mcp/`, which #607's directory
# rule already covers wholesale — the one axis that is blind to both the name and the format.
#
# Measured while doing #703 (@playwright/mcp 0.0.78, own `--isolated --headless` server, own
# stdio client, throwaway origin, cwd = a real checkout of this repo):
#   * all four text writers accept the prefix and land in `.playwright-mcp/`, where
#     `git check-ignore --no-index -v` answers `.gitignore:26:.playwright-mcp/`;
#   * they also accept a SUBDIRECTORY (`src/vikunja_mcp/…md` landed beside the sources,
#     unignored), so the spill was never root-confined and a root-only rule could not have
#     covered it;
#   * `--output-dir` cannot be the fix: a caller-chosen `filename` is resolved by a different
#     function than the auto-named artifacts (`workspaceFile()` against the workspace/cwd versus
#     `outputFile()` against the output dir), so with `--output-dir` pointed OUTSIDE the repo the

# That flag feeds `outputFile()`, i.e. the AUTO-named artifacts — and one of them, `page-*.yml`,
# is the aria snapshot, which is the page's TEXT: exactly the payload #703 exists for, arriving
# by a different door. `<каталог с id задачи>` reads equally as a subdirectory of the worktree
# and as one of the scratchpad, and the first reading is not covered by anything.
#
# MEASURED for this card (@playwright/mcp@latest, own `--isolated --headless` server, own stdio
# client, throwaway origin on 127.0.0.1:20736, cwd = this worktree):
#   * `--output-dir 736-out` (inside the tree, named after the task exactly as the old recipe
#     invites) wrote `page-<ts>.yml` + `console-<ts>.log` + `page-<ts>.png`. `git status` showed
#     `?? 736-out/`; `git check-ignore --no-index -v` exited 1 for the `.yml` and the `.log` and
#     0 only for the `.png` (`.gitignore:123:*.png`, #629's rule); `git add -A --dry-run` STAGED
#     both text files. Their contents carried the probe markers planted on the page — the aria
#     text, and a link's `?token=` query string in the `.yml`, another in the `.log`.
#   * `--output-dir .playwright-mcp/736`: same three files, `git status` empty, `git add -A
#     --dry-run` empty, every one answering `.gitignore:26:.playwright-mcp/`.
#   * `--output-dir` pointed OUTSIDE the repo works — no `File access denied … outside allowed
#     roots`. That refusal is real but belongs to the caller-chosen `filename` path (a different
#     resolver); `--output-dir` DEFINES a root rather than escaping one. So "outside" is a valid
#     answer too, and SKILL.md says so; it is not the PRESCRIBED one, because it splits one
#     server's output across two places and leaves `.playwright-mcp/` uncreated.
#   * WHEN the directory appears: not at server start and not after `initialize` — the first
#     `browser_navigate` creates it, INCLUDING a missing `.playwright-mcp/` parent, after which a
#     caller-chosen `filename` under that prefix succeeded with no manual `mkdir -p`.
#
# The value SKILL.md prints after `--output-dir`, in the spellings this rulebook uses: a fenced
# command line, and prose where the flag and its value sit inside ONE backtick pair (`` `--output
# -dir .playwright-mcp/<id>` ``). What keeps the many BARE mentions of the flag out is `\s+`, and
# nothing cleverer: SKILL.md has nine `--output-dir` occurrences and seven of them are
# `` `--output-dir` `` followed by prose, where the next character is the closing BACKTICK, not
# whitespace, so the pattern never starts a value there.
#
# A negative lookahead `(?!`)` stood here first, with a comment crediting it for exactly that.
# The sweep disproved it: on the two rulebook-facing files, control 0 failed; deleting the
# lookahead measured 0 failed too, because `\s+` had been doing the work all along. Dead code is
# bad enough; dead code with a paragraph explaining its importance is what this repo keeps
# catching, so it is gone rather than kept "for safety".
#
# BOTH separators, and the `=` half is here because an independent attack pass BUILT the evasion,
# exactly as one did for `PRESCRIBED_FILENAME_RE` twenty lines up — the same defect, reintroduced
# by a pattern written from the spelling that happened to be in the file. Measured on the server
# first: `--output-dir=736-out` behaves identically to the space form (three artifacts in
# `736-out/`, `git add -A --dry-run` staging the `.yml` and the `.log`). Then on the gate, with
# only `\s+` here: control 0 failed; recipe rewritten to `--output-dir=554-out` -> 0 failed. Fully
# green while the line an agent copies spilled the page's text, because the recipe stopped
# matching and the lone prose value satisfied every assertion below. With `(?:\s+|=)` the same
# round measures 1 failed, and the equals form pointed at the RIGHT directory measures 0 — caught
# without a false red.
#
# The residual is real and is left LOUD on purpose: this reads PROSE. An `--output-dir` written
# WITHOUT backticks in a sentence hands the next word to git as if it were a path — measured, a
# round that unbackticks one prose mention goes red naming a Russian word. That is a false RED,
# which is noise; the failure mode this repo refuses is the quiet one.

# a prose restatement is a fine edit and must not be a test edit. What that costs is measured, not
# guessed: a PROSE mention alone satisfies this floor, so deleting the flag from the fenced recipe
# left everything here green (control 0 failed; that mutation 0 failed).
#
# An earlier version of this comment went one step further and said raising the floor "would not
# have caught it either". That was a counterfactual, not a measurement, and an attack pass
# measured it FALSE: control 0 failed; floor 2 + the flag deleted from the fence -> 2 failed, one
# of them this very floor, because SKILL.md prints exactly ONE prose restatement today. The
# argument survives, the claim did not — a floor COUNTS, it cannot LOCATE, so at 2 it would catch

# server, own stdio client, own throwaway origin on 127.0.0.1:20751, cwd = this worktree): with
# an `"outputDir"` naming `cfg-out-751`, the three auto-named artifacts landed there, `git
# status` showed `?? cfg-out-751/`, and `git add -A --dry-run` STAGED `page-*.yml` and
# `console-*.log`. Their contents carried the probe markers — the aria text and a link's
# `?token=` query string in the `.yml`, the console line and the same token in the `.log`. Only
# the `.png` was covered, by #629's `*.png`. That is #736's leak arriving through a third door.
#
# TWO THINGS THE CARD'S OWN FRAMING GOT WRONG, both measured rather than reasoned, and both
# shaping this pin instead of just its comment.
#
# FIRST, "the THIRD door" undercounts, which is the same overclaim-by-enumeration this file has
# been bitten by before. Two ENV VARS set the same directory with no flag on the line at all:
# `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR=env-out-751` put the three artifacts in `env-out-751/`, and
# `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG=<path>` picked up the very same config file. So enumerating FLAGS can
# never close this; the axis is the DIRECTORY, which is why the prescription SKILL.md states —
# and this pin checks — is a directory rather than a flag list.
#
# SECOND, and it is what keeps the exposure small: the EXPLICIT `--output-dir` flag BEATS all
# three. Measured pairwise — the flag against the config, against `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR`,
# and against `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG` — every round put the three files in `.playwright-mcp/751`
# and created the foreign directory NOT AT ALL. So the recipe is safe from a stray config and
# from an inherited env var for as long as it keeps its flag, which is pinned inside the fence by
# `test_the_browser_answer_leads_with_the_isolation_an_agent_can_launch_itself`. What is left
# open is the agent that DROPS the flag and configures the server instead, and that is what
# SKILL.md now names and this pattern now reads.
#
# The JSON spelling, because that is what an `--config` file holds and what SKILL.md prints:
# `"outputDir": "<value>"`. The value stops at the closing quote, at a comma or at the closing
# brace, so an inline one-key object reads correctly. A BARE `` `"outputDir"` `` in prose does
# NOT match and must not: there is no colon after it, so the pattern never starts a value there —
# which is what lets the paragraph above NAME the key without handing this pin a word to check.
PRESCRIBED_CONFIG_OUTPUT_DIR_RE = re.compile(
    r"""["'`]?\boutputDir\b["'`]?\s*:\s*["'`]([^"'`\s,}]+)"""
)

# Same shape of floor and same reason as its two neighbours: a pattern that matches nothing
# passes everything. SKILL.md prints exactly ONE such value today — the prescription in the
# `--config` bullet — and the floor sits at 1 because that is also the honest minimum: this is a
# rule about where a config must point, not a demand that the rulebook carry N examples.
MIN_PRESCRIBED_CONFIG_OUTPUT_DIRS = 1

# What an `--output-dir` actually receives, so the pin asks git about a FILE rather than about a
# directory name. Both are auto-named artifacts measured landing there in this card's runs, and
# both are the case no other rule in this repo reaches: the `.yml` is the page's aria text, the
# `.log` its console (URLs with query strings included).
#
# The `.png` from the same run is deliberately NOT probed, and the reason is narrower than the
# first draft of this comment claimed. #629's `*.png` is DIRECTORY-BLIND — measured,
# `git check-ignore` answers `.gitignore:123:*.png` for `554-out/page-<ts>.png` and for
# `any/dir/at/all/page-x.png` alike — so a png probe can never report a directory drift. Measured
# rather than reasoned: narrowing the probes to the png AND drifting the recipe to `554-out`
# still went red, but on the separate RULE assertion below, with the git-backed check green.
# So a png probe would not make this pin decoration; it would make the GIT-BACKED half of it
# blind, leaving the rule assertion below as the only assertion HERE that still sees a directory
# drift — and that one checks the prefix as a string, not what git would do with it.

# The browser's TEXT artifacts, which until VMCP-209 (752) had no content lock at all — the
# asymmetry that card was filed for. The binary ones are held by leading magic bytes under any
# name (#629) and a storage state by the two list-valued keys above; the text ones were held only
# by PROSE rules, which pin what the rulebook PRINTS (#703's explicit `filename`, #736's
# `--output-dir`, #751's `--config`) and not what lands on disk. Every future flag the rulebook
# does not print walks past all three.
#
# `.gitignore` used to say a content axis had been "considered and dropped", on two grounds. Both
# were re-measured on this card and only ONE of them survived.
#
# WRONG: "it fires on any file that DOCUMENTS it — this comment included." That is true of a
# MARKER GREP and false of the classifier below, and the difference is the same one the
# storage-state gate already relies on: that gate does not scan for the string `"cookies"`, it
# requires the candidate to BE a JSON object with two list-valued keys, so a file that merely
# discusses the shape is not a candidate. The text analogue is a WHOLE-FILE grammar — EVERY
# non-blank line must match, over a minimum line count — which makes a fenced six-line quotation
# inside two hundred lines of prose a non-candidate rather than a false red. Measured both ways
# on this tree, and the two answers differ only AFTER this card lands: see
# `test_the_naive_marker_grep_would_be_red_on_arrival_and_the_whole_file_grammar_is_not`.
#
# RIGHT, and narrowed rather than dropped: "it reaches `browser_snapshot` alone of the four."
# Measured against real artifacts from an own `--isolated --headless` server (0.0.78 line,
# `@playwright/mcp@latest` on 2026-08-05, own throwaway origin, own stdio client), it reaches
# THREE of the four text writers, and the fourth is out of reach for a structural reason rather
# than for want of trying: `browser_evaluate` writes whatever the evaluated JS returned, so it
# has no grammar to match. Its measured output was the JSON string literal
# `"<page text with \n escapes>"`, which is indistinguishable from any other JSON string — the
# one place the retired word "indistinguishable" is still the right one.
#
# The grammars, transcribed from those runs rather than from the filing card (which had two
# details wrong, both corrected here: the console level is `WARNING`, not `WARN`, and a `ref`
# token is frame-qualified — `[ref=f1e1]` — on any page that is not the first document):
#
#   aria snapshot (`page-*.yml`, and `browser_snapshot(filename=…)` byte-identically):
#       - generic [active] [ref=e1]:
#         - heading "…" [level=1] [ref=e2]
#         - link "go next" [ref=e4] [cursor=pointer]:
#           - /url: /next?token=…
#   console  (`console-*.log`):   [      54ms] [LOG] … @ http://…:9
#   console  (explicit filename): Total messages: 3 (Errors: 1, Warnings: 1) / [LOG] … @ …
#   network  (explicit filename): 2. [GET] http://…?token=… => [404] Not Found
#
# TWO PROPERTIES OF THE CONSOLE FORM WERE NOT PROBED, and VMCP-237 (798) found both by driving
# its own server against a page built to STRESS the grammar rather than demonstrate it. A
# transcription is only as wide as the run it came from, and the run above emitted three tidy
# single-line messages with no level filter:
#   * a MULTI-LINE message is not flattened the way aria content is — `console.log("a\nb")`
#     writes `[LOG] a`, then `b`, then the location — so its continuation lines match no console
#     pattern at all. Present in BOTH forms.
#   * a FILTERED export writes a second header line, `Returning 12 messages for level "info"`.
# Either one alone was enough to make a real console export classify as NOTHING, which is what
# the shipped grammar did to both of the exports 798 captured. The lesson is the one the aria
# side already learnt two bullets down and the console side had not: a matcher requiring EVERY
# line to match is only as good as its worst input, and the worst input is not the one you
# reached for when you wrote it.
#
# Two properties of the aria form were probed rather than assumed, because a matcher requiring
# EVERY line to match is only as good as its worst input. Multi-line page content — `<pre>`,
# `<textarea>`, `<blockquote>` — is FLATTENED onto one line, and embedded quotes are escaped, so
# the one-item-per-line grammar survives content designed to break it. And the `ref` counter
# restarts per snapshot but keeps its `[ref=` prefix in both spellings.

# The scan has to READ a candidate to classify it, so it needs a ceiling on a single read. What
# that ceiling may NOT be is a silent skip, and the first version of it was exactly that:
# `1 << 20`, justified by "a credential export that big is not a thing" — a universal about every
# storage state there is, inferred from one 455-byte export and never measured.
#
# MEASURED (constructed here, synthetic values throughout): a correctly-shaped export with one
# origin, one small session key and one 4 MiB localStorage entry is 4,194,662 bytes. Under the old
# cap it sat in the tree as `?? tracker-login.json` — the very name UNCOVERED_NAMES designates as
# layer two's whole reason to exist — and the suite measured `1 passed`; flipping ONLY the cap to
# `1 << 30` measured FAIL. Layer two was evadable by making the file BIGGER, and the cap alone was
# what allowed it.
# STRUCTURAL, not measured here, and it is what says no cap can be justified as "bigger than any
# credential": the format carries a `localStorage` array PER ORIGIN (that is the shape this file
# matches on), and Playwright fills it from every origin the context visited, so the size grows
# with origins x their contents and has no fixed upper bound to appeal to. Per-origin localStorage
# quotas are documented by browsers in the single-digit-MB range, which is why the 4 MiB above is
# an ordinary file rather than an exotic one — that number is cited, not measured here.
#
# So this is a READ-SAFETY ceiling, not a claim about credentials, and crossing it FAILS the gate
# instead of skipping the file: "too big to classify" and "a fat credential" look identical from
# here, and only a human can tell them apart.
#
# What it costs, measured on this tree: the candidate set (`git ls-files` union
# untracked-and-not-ignored) is 62 files / 1.582 MiB, the largest being `uv.lock` at 148,126 bytes
# — 453x below the ceiling, so today it neither skips nor reports anything, and the old 1 MiB cap
# had nothing above it either. That cap bought exactly zero while leaving the hole above. What
# this one buys: one `read_text` + `json.loads` cannot pull an unbounded working-tree file into
# memory. Measured at that size: a 67,109,130-byte shaped file reads and parses in 72 ms with a
# 128 MiB peak (tracemalloc), which is the most this gate will spend before it stops guessing and
# reports instead.

# --- Is this tree a git checkout at all? (#622) ---------------------------------------------
#
# Most pins here ask GIT a question and assert on its exit code, which makes them meaningless —
# not failing, MEANINGLESS — in a tree git does not track: a `git archive`/sdist extraction, a
# copied tree, any derived measurement environment. They used to FAIL there, 30 ids of them,
# with `fatal: not a git repository … assert 128 == 0`, and that cost a real measurement: #594's
# mutation sweep ran in exactly such a tree and its author read the raw `N failed` counts as
# mutation KILL counts. Every row of a six-row table was inflated by precisely these 30 and the
# headline conclusion came out wrong by a factor of 16. A CONSTANT failure is the dangerous kind:
# it survives any before/after comparison intact, so it does not look like noise, it looks
# like signal.
#
# The probe is a FILESYSTEM fact, deliberately NOT `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, and the
# difference is not stylistic. `rev-parse` walks UP. Measured while writing this: an extraction
# placed inside another repository (a `build/` directory under a checkout is the ordinary way
# that happens) answers exit 0 there and names the OUTER repo — so a rev-parse probe would
# decline to skip, and these pins would go on to interrogate the wrong repository, reporting
# things like "`.claude/settings.json` is not carried by git" about a repo that was never asked
# about. `.git` at REPO_ROOT ITSELF (a directory in a main checkout, a `gitdir:` FILE in a linked
# worktree — which is where the parallel drain's per-task agents run, so that case is the common
# one, not an edge) is the question actually being asked, costs one stat, and cannot walk
# anywhere.
#
# It also never reads git's EXIT CODE, and that is what stops the skip from becoming an
# off-switch. "No repository" is a MISSING `.git`; "git failed" is a non-zero exit WITH a `.git`
# present — two different facts from two different sources, which is the only arrangement in
# which one cannot mask the other. So a git that is broken inside a real checkout (no binary, a
# corrupt repo, unreadable objects) leaves `.git` exactly where it is: nothing skips, and the
# original assertions go red as loudly as before. Both directions are pinned in
# `test_the_checkout_probe_is_not_an_off_switch_for_a_broken_git`.

    the same `.gitignore` covers a different set of names on macOS (true) than on Linux (false),
    which is where CI runs. Left as None the call reports what THIS machine does; passed
    explicitly it reports what a given platform does, identically on either — which is the only
    way a pin about case can mean the same thing in both places.

    Measured rather than inferred from the .gitignore text, and every part of this call shape

    * `--no-index` is REQUIRED. Without it `check-ignore` consults the index first and reports
      every TRACKED path as "not ignored" — so the moment this settings file is committed the
      check becomes a tautology that passes under any .gitignore at all. Measured: blanket
      `.claude/` + the file staged -> exit 1 (not ignored) with the index, exit 0 (ignored)
      with `--no-index`.
    * the verdict comes from the QUIET call, never the verbose one. `-v` exits 0 whenever ANY
      pattern matched, a NEGATIVE one included, so it reports "ignored" for a file the repo
      deliberately re-includes. Measured on both.
    * the SOURCE is why `-v` is called at all. The first version of this helper returned the
      verdict alone, and the mutation round that deletes `.claude/*` came back GREEN: the
      machine running the suite has `**/.claude/settings.local.json` in `~/.config/git/ignore`,
      so "is the local state still hidden?" was being answered by the user's own global config
      instead of by this repo. A pin that passes because of a file outside the repo is not a
      pin, so the caller checks that the deciding rule LIVES IN this repo's `.gitignore`.

    Exit 128 (no repo, no git, a bad path) is neither 0 nor 1 and would otherwise read as
    "not ignored" — a green from a failed measurement, the exact failure shape this repo has

def test_gitignore_still_lets_the_settings_file_through():
    """The negation is the whole delivery mechanism, and it can be defeated without being removed.

    `.gitignore` hides `.claude/*` (machine-local state: settings.local.json, worktrees/,
    mailbox/, the scheduler's lock) and re-includes this one shared file. The trap the file's
    own comment records is that the blanket spelling `.claude/` makes the re-inclusion
    IMPOSSIBLE — git cannot re-include a file whose PARENT DIRECTORY is excluded, so the
    directory rule wins the pattern contest and the `!` line below it never fires. Both
    spellings look equally reasonable in a diff, and the `!` line survives the swap untouched,
    so a pin that greps for the `!` line and stops is a false green.

    THAT REASON WAS WRONG UNTIL VMCP-264 (874), here, in the assertion message below and in
    `.gitignore` itself, and the wrong one is the tempting one: all three said git NEVER
    DESCENDS into an excluded directory. Measured on git 2.50.1 (Apple Git-155), it does — under
    the call this grid makes, `git status --porcelain --ignored`, it opens the directory with
    NOTHING in the index at all (`chmod 000 d`, warning printed, 5 fresh repos out of 5, both
    spellings). Naming the index as the trigger, which this sentence did until round 3, is wrong
    in both directions: not necessary, by that cell, and not sufficient, because with a tracked
    anchor present a plain `status --porcelain` under blanket `d/` does NOT open it (0 of 5).
    What the index changes is the REPORTING. An ignored `d/` holding three ignored files, an
    ignored subdirectory and one TRACKED `d/anchor.txt` is reported by `git status --porcelain
    --ignored` as four entries; drop the tracked file and the same tree collapses to one `d/`.
    Four ENTRIES and not four files: the fourth is `d/y/`, the subdirectory holding no indexed
    path, reported whole. Collapsed is NOT unwalked, and calling it that was this round's own
    first draft: measured, an EMPTY `d/y/` produces no entry at all, a file buried at `d/y/z/q`
    still produces exactly `!! d/y/`, and `chmod 000 d/y` makes the entry VANISH behind `warning:
    could not open directory 'd/y/'`. Git opens the subtree and then reports the topmost wholly
    ignored directory, so what is decided per directory is the REPORTING. (VMCP-249 (840) states
    the same fact from the other side, about which entries a `removed_ignored` list can name.)

    **THE CORRECTION THEN OVERSHOT, AND THAT IS THE SECOND THING 874 FIXED — here, in the same
    paragraph, in the round after the first.** It closed with "the SPELLING does not enter into
    that at all … so what decides the walk is a tracked path in the index, not the rule's
    shape", which is a fresh universal in place of the old one, and one `04c126b` (VMCP-249)
    had already retracted IN THIS TREE one landing earlier (a bot bump between them): "the
    spellings agree when the re-included file is tracked or absent, not always". Measured, four
    cells, `git status --porcelain --ignored` counting `!! ` lines, `git ls-files` asked each
    time rather than assumed:

        index EMPTY under `d/`, no `!` line ................ `d/` 1    `d/*` 1    agree
        index EMPTY, `!d/keep.txt`, keep.txt ON DISK ....... `d/` 1    `d/*` 4    DIVERGE
        index EMPTY, `!d/keep.txt`, keep.txt ABSENT ........ `d/` 1    `d/*` 1    agree
        tracked `d/anchor.txt`, no `!` line ................ `d/` 4    `d/*` 4    agree

    So a tracked path forces the ENUMERATION under EITHER spelling (row 4) — sufficient UNDER
    THE CALL THIS GRID MAKES, never the only trigger, and not a fact about the walk at all.
    Both of those need the call named, and round 3 had to make that correction TWICE, the
    second time in the sentence that made it the first time: `status.showUntrackedFiles=no`,
    the setting #766 found live in this ecosystem and the levers paragraph names below, takes
    this very row to 0 entries on BOTH spellings, so there the tracked path forces nothing; and
    under a plain `status --porcelain` that same anchor leaves blanket `d/` unopened while
    `d/*` opens it (0 of 5 against 5 of 5, fresh repos). Row 2 has NOTHING
    in the index on either side and the spelling still decides,
    because under `d/*` the `!` line un-ignores a file that is on disk and untracked, so git can
    no longer call that directory wholly ignored and has to enumerate it — `?? d/` sits beside
    those four, the DIRECTORY, the file itself being named only at `-uall` — and to enumerate it
    it must walk. Under blanket `d/` that same `!` line cannot fire, which is the pattern fact
    above, so there is nothing to force the ENUMERATION and the directory collapses to one
    entry. It is still walked: that is the same cell, and `chmod 000` on a SUBDIRECTORY of it
    prints the warning while the one entry survives. Collapsing is what the `!` line stops
    forcing here, never the opening.

    DO NOT READ THAT GRID AS A CLOSED SET, in either direction. Further levers keep turning up
    and each one was found by looking rather than by reasoning: `-uall`, equivalently
    `status.showUntrackedFiles=all`, which is config anyone can set, gives 4 on BOTH spellings
    in row 1; `--ignored=matching` makes ROW 1 ITSELF diverge, 1 against 4, with an empty index,
    no `!` line and no `-uall` — so that row's "agree" is a property of the default `--ignored`
    mode and not of the spellings; and `status.showUntrackedFiles=no`, the setting #766 found
    live in this ecosystem, takes row 2 to 0 on BOTH — but from 4 on the `d/*` side and from 1
    on the blanket one, which are the two numbers row 2 already carries.
    Counting them in the prose is
    exactly what this docstring must not do, and the first draft of the `.gitignore` comment
    beside it said "all three levers" while two more were a single `status` flag away.
    "1 entry against N" is in any case the granularity of THIS call and never "git refused to
    walk": `git ls-files -o -i --exclude-standard` lists all four files under blanket `d/` with
    an empty index. Even the tracked row survives only in one reading — add the `!` line to it
    AND put `keep.txt` on disk and `d/` gives 5 against `d/*`'s 4, so both spellings DESCEND
    there while their entries differ. The `!` line ALONE does not do it: with `keep.txt` absent
    that row is 4 against 4, so the on-disk file is half the trigger and naming only the line
    would be the same overshoot in miniature.

    What the spelling really decides is the PATTERN contest, and that one is independent of the
    walk: `d/` plus `!d/keep.txt` answers `.gitignore:1:d/` and a plain `git add d/keep.txt` is
    refused, leaving the index empty; change one character to `d/*` and the same negation
    answers `.gitignore:2:!d/keep.txt`, the add succeeds and the file is staged. Re-measured
    with a force-added anchor present, i.e. with the walk FORCED, and both answers are
    unchanged — which is what makes it a fact about patterns rather than about walking. On this
    repository's own rules the pair reads `.claude/settings.json` -> `!.claude/settings.json`
    and `.claude/settings.local.json` -> `.claude/*`.

    NO ASSERTION WAS ADDED FOR THAT, deliberately, and the card asking for the correction asked
    for the decision too. The pattern-level fact is carried by the MESSAGE OF THE FIRST
    assertion below — 874 rewrote that message, and the blanket-spelling round in the sweep
    reddens exactly it (measured: `assert not True`, quoting `.claude/` as the rule git
    applied). Naming the SECOND assertion there was the round-one draft's third error: the
    first assertion fails, so execution never reaches the second at all, which would have made
    it an assertion no round reaches — the thing the git-first-and-literal-last paragraph below
    forbids (named, not counted: this used to say "two paragraphs down" and the count was
    already wrong before round 3's own edits moved it again).
    The second assertion states a different fact, provenance (the rule that let the file
    through is a `!` line from THIS repo), and the round that FAILS it is deleting BOTH lines.
    Not "the round that reaches it", which was the third error's own first correction: five of
    the seven rounds REACH that assertion and FOUR of them pass it — the fifth is delete-BOTH,
    the round the previous sentence names as failing it, so reach and pass are not the same
    count and the first correction's own "reach that assertion and pass it" welded them into
    one. Instrumented per round (each round's `.gitignore` written, then the four assertions
    evaluated in source order): reached by 5 of 7, passed by 4, failed by 1. The
    delete-`.claude/*` round is among the four that pass,
    where it was instrumented and answered `.gitignore` / `!.claude/settings.json` on its way to
    failing the NEXT one. Reaching and failing are different questions and this paragraph has
    now got the distinction wrong in both directions. `_ignore_rule` is also not "`git
    check-ignore -v`", which was the draft's warrant: it is TWO calls, both `--no-index`, the
    verdict from `-q` and the source from `-v` — and the helper's own docstring, far above, says
    why each of those is load-bearing (no line count here: SKILL.md's rule, a number written
    into prose moves with the next edit above it, and the one this sentence inherited was off by
    some 180 lines). Measured here, a bare `check-ignore -v` on `.claude/settings.json` is rc=1
    and prints NOTHING, so the draft's warrant does not even run. Only the EXPLANATION was ever
    false — in three places at first landing, and in two more of its own making, this docstring
    and that same `.gitignore` comment — and only explanations are changed.

    Hence assertions of three different kinds: the negation is still WRITTEN (deleting it and
    the blanket together would leave the file deliverable but no longer deliberately so), git
    ITSELF still delivers the file and does so BECAUSE OF a rule in this repo (the half a grep
    cannot answer), and the sibling machine-local path is STILL hidden by this repo's own rule
    — without which the negation would be vacuous: a .gitignore that hides nothing under
    `.claude` trivially "re-includes" everything, and the next agent's settings.local.json
    lands in someone's commit.

    Every verdict is paired with its SOURCE, which is not decoration — see `_ignore_rule`:
    written without it, the local-state half was answered by `~/.config/git/ignore` on the
    machine that ran the suite, and the mutation that deletes `.claude/*` passed.

    The assertions run git-first and literal-last so that each one has a mutation that REACHES
    it — an assertion no round can reach is a claim nobody has tested. The literal spelling is
    pinned deliberately, as the statement of intent behind the behaviour above it: a legitimate
    respelling (`!/.claude/settings.json` is equivalent to git) has to update this line on
    purpose, which is the point.

    MUTATION-CHECKED, and re-run WHOLE on the corrected prose for VMCP-264 (874) round 2 —
    this test alone, `collected 1 item` in every round, `-q` dropped, `FAILED `/`ERROR ` lines
    counted separately (never the first `N failed` in stdout, which in this file is a docstring
    quoting its own control), `__pycache__` cleared with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, mutations
    in a SEPARATE clone, `.gitignore` restored from a COPY and confirmed sha256-identical.
    Every round names WHICH assertion it reached, because round 1 got exactly that wrong:
    control 0 failed, 0 errors; replace `.claude/*` with a blanket `.claude/` while KEEPING the
    `!` line -> 1 failed on the FIRST assertion, the verdict, which is the round that justifies
    asking git at all; delete the `!.claude/settings.json` line -> 1 failed, FIRST assertion
    again; delete BOTH lines -> 1 failed on the SECOND, provenance, because no rule in this repo
    decides the settings file's fate any more — the only round that FAILS it, and NOT the only
    one that REACHES it, which is what the NO ASSERTION WAS ADDED paragraph retracts:
    instrumented, five of the seven rounds reach that assertion and four pass it;
    delete the `.claude/*` line alone so nothing under `.claude` is hidden -> 1 failed on the
    THIRD, local-state provenance (and see `_ignore_rule`: without the source this round passed,
    via `~/.config/git/ignore` — which is what git names in the failure text ON THE MACHINE THAT
    RAN THIS SWEEP, and nowhere near a durable fact: with no global ignore, as on CI's fresh
    `HOME`, the same round still fails and names `None`); respell as `!/.claude/settings.json`
    -> 1 failed on the FOURTH, the
    literal; rewrite the explanatory comment above the rules -> 0 failed, PASS. Control re-run
    after the last restore, 0 failed. Re-run WHOLE a third time on THIS prose (round 3): control
    0 failed at the start AND at the end, `collected 1 item` in all eight rounds, 0 `ERROR `
    lines throughout, `.gitignore` restored from a copy and confirmed sha256-identical after
    every round, and the same six attributions — but read from pytest's own failing LINE under
    `--tb=line` (two rounds on the first assertion, then one each on the second, third and
    fourth; the numbers themselves are not written down, having moved once already under this
    card's own edits) rather than by grepping stdout, which does NOT work
    here and silently agrees with you: the traceback prints the test's source UP TO the failing
    statement, so every PRECEDING assertion's message is in the output as source, and a grep
    for the first one therefore matches in every round that gets past it — which tagged all
    five failures as the first assertion. Not "every message in every round", which was this
    sentence's own first try: measured by occurrence count, the blanket round carries the first
    message TWICE (source plus failure) and the other three not at all, while the
    delete-`.claude/*` round carries the first two once each and the third twice. So the
    discriminator, for anyone who insists on grepping, is the COUNT and not the presence.
    That final PASS is why this card changed comments and not
    rules — and it says as plainly that the prose corrected here is no more pinned than the
    prose it replaced, which is what the second independent pass is for.

    `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_STORAGE_STATE` is upstream's documented complement to `--isolated`, and
    measured on the installed 0.0.78 it really does compose: with isolation on, the file's
    cookies and localStorage ARE restored (the browser then sent them, so the origin's own
    request log is what says so) and no profile touches disk. What it does NOT do is write:
    after a login, `browser_close` and a clean shutdown the file was byte-identical, and the
    next session read back the seed rather than the login. So there is no version of this that
    ships as a committed setting, for two INDEPENDENT reasons, and the test holds the weaker
    of them because it is the one an edit could plausibly forget:

    * the value is an absolute path to LIVE SESSION COOKIES — a credential for whatever the
      human was logged into, this project's tracker included — and this repository is PUBLIC.
      Its class is `.vikunja-mcp.env` and `VIKUNJA_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK`: env layers only, never a
      committed file. Its SIBLING in this very file is the opposite kind (team policy that
      belongs in git), which is exactly the mix that invites "well, the isolation flag lives
      here, so its companion should too".
    * a committed path would also be inert-to-hostile for everyone else: measured, a path
      whose file does not exist yet makes EVERY `browser_*` call fail with `Error reading
      storage state … ENOENT`, so a clone would get a browser that does not work at all.

    A negative pin can hold nothing and stay green, so this one is mutation-checked in the
    direction that matters — by ADDING the thing it forbids (`__pycache__` cleared between
    rounds, exactly 1 test selected per round, settings restored from a COPY): control PASS;
    add `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_STORAGE_STATE` to the `env` block -> FAIL; add it with an innocuous

    `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS=storage`, and it resolves a relative `filename` against the MCP
    server's cwd — the main checkout. With no filename it writes
    `.playwright-mcp/storage-state-<timestamp>.json`; asked the obvious way
    (`filename: "state585.json"`) it dropped 455 bytes containing a live cookie in the repo

    This asks GIT rather than grepping .gitignore — the lesson its siblings above record
    twice: a pattern can be present and defeated (by an earlier blanket rule, by a stray

    property of this repository at all. Hence both halves: git excludes the path, AND the rule
    that decided lives in THIS repo.

    """The honesty half of #629 — and here the gap is structural, not an oversight in the list.

    An extension rule assumes the name says what the file is. It does not: the format comes from
    the `type` argument (an enum of png|jpeg) and the name is passed through untouched. MEASURED
    in both directions, `file(1)` judging each time — `filename: "vmcp629-noext"` (no extension at
    all) and `filename: "vmcp629-shot.bin"` each wrote 15,580 bytes of "PNG image data"; a `.jpg`
    name with `type` left at its png default wrote PNG; and a `.png` name with `type: "jpeg"`
    wrote JPEG, i.e. an extension rule can be "covering" a file that is really the other format.
    So layer one cannot be completed by adding extensions, and
    `test_no_file_of_browser_artifact_shape_is_reachable_by_git` below is what actually covers
    those cases: it reads bytes.

    The last four parameters are the part NEITHER layer reaches, which is why they are pinned
    here rather than quietly omitted. `tools/list` showed SEVEN tools with a `filename` property
    on the DEFAULT capability set — the one the shared session server runs, whose cwd IS the main
    checkout — of which six write and one (`browser_run_code_unsafe`) reads. Measured on 0.0.78
    by spawning the server and reading `tools/list` over stdio. What says the SHARED server is on
    that set is its ROSTER, not the absence of a `--caps` flag: capabilities also arrive by
    `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS` (the channel this file's cap-setting measurements use) and by
    `--config`. Nor does the flag settle it the other way: measured, `--caps bogus` serves the
    default 24, for the reason recorded below. So the bare `npx @playwright/mcp@latest` in the
    plugin's own `.mcp.json` is evidence and not proof.
    Measured on the roster instead: the browser tools this session is offered are these same
    default 24, name for name, with no `browser_pdf_save`, `browser_start_video` or
    `browser_storage_state` among them.

    A tool total "with every capability on" is deliberately NOT the anchor used for the
    non-default tools named around here, and that is the correction this round was bounced for.
    The label APPEARED in 690d648 three times over, in three files and on three different
    quantities: `.gitignore` hung it on a tool total of 53, CLAUDE.md on an acceptor count of
    "ten", this docstring on "ten and eight" acceptors and writers. Only the first is a TOTAL,
    which is what this paragraph retracts; the other two are wrong too and are corrected below
    (11 and nine). A pickaxe search for the lower-case phrase finds only the first two, and TWO
    things hide the third from it independently: the phrase wraps across a line break there, and
    it opens a sentence — `git log -S` is case-sensitive, so even unwrapped the capital `W`
    would not match. Do not read a COMMIT COUNT off that search either: a sentence quoting the
    phrase writes it back into a file the search reads, so its answer moves with the discussion
    rather than with the defect.
    53 is not that set, and 53 does not identify a set at all: measured,
    `pdf,devtools,storage` gives 53 tools with 11 `filename` acceptors, while
    `config,devtools,storage` and `pdf,storage,vision,testing` each give 53 with 10 — so which
    run produced that sentence cannot be recovered from the number. Every capability on really is
    69, i.e. all twelve members of the `ToolCapability` union in the package's own `config.d.ts`,
    also with 11 acceptors. Three measured traps stand behind the muddle. Unknown cap names are
    accepted SILENTLY: `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS=bogus` starts cleanly, writes nothing to stderr and
    serves the default 24, so a cap that does not exist reads exactly like a cap that adds
    nothing.
    And "a cap that adds nothing" is itself CHANNEL-DEPENDENT, which is the trap that put
    `tracing` and `verify` into these cap lists in the first place (#704). The two channels agree
    on all twelve DECLARED caps — `--caps=<all 12>` and `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS=<all 12>` both serve
    69 with the same 11 acceptors — so it is tempting to call them equivalent; they are not.
    Measured: `--caps=tracing` serves 35 and `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS=tracing` serves 24, and
    `--caps=pdf,tracing` serves 36 against the env form's 25. The cause is in the bundled
    `playwright-core/lib/coreBundle.js`, in the CLI's own `.action()` handler —
    `if (options.caps?.includes("tracing")) options.caps.push("devtools")` — an undeclared
    back-compat alias that the env path (`configFromEnv`) never runs, so `tracing` is a live
    +11 on the flag and inert as a variable. `verify` serves 24 on BOTH and is simply not a
    capability, despite `browser_verify_*` tools existing under `testing`. So a cap sweep is
    comparable only against sweeps taken through the SAME channel, and "measured +0" means
    nothing without saying which one carried it.
    And "writers = acceptors − 1" stops holding once `storage` is on, because
    `browser_set_storage_state` reads its file too ("Path to the storage state file to restore
    from") — by the schemas that is 11 acceptors and NINE writers, not ten. Those two numbers are
    read off the schemas; the writing is not, and it is not confined to the default set either.
    Every one of the nine has its output recorded here as OBSERVED: the six default ones above,
    `browser_pdf_save` (the PDF signature at `BROWSER_BINARY_SIGNATURES` was transcribed from a
    file it wrote, and its own default name is pinned in `EXPLICIT_ARTIFACT_COVERED`),
    `browser_start_video` (the WebM — but measured, it only NAMES the file and returns with the
    cwd empty; the bytes arrive when `browser_stop_video` stops the recording, so the acceptor
    and the write are not the same call), and `browser_storage_state` (`state585.json`, 455
    bytes, at the storage-state test above — card #585's run, not this card's). Counts move with
    an external package pulled at a floating `@latest`; a cap name does not. Reproducing either
    costs a server spawn plus the `initialize` / `initialized` / `tools/list` handshake —
    0.0.78's `--help` lists no tools, so there is no one-command form. browser_snapshot,
    browser_console_messages, browser_network_requests and browser_evaluate all put their output
    in the checkout root too.
    Measured content: a marker planted in the probe page's text came back inside the snapshot,
    the extensionless snapshot and the evaluate result; a token placed in a request's query
    string came back in the console and the network dumps. They are plain text under a caller's
    name — no extension worth excluding, no magic number to read — so the honest statement is
    that this guard reduces the accident and does not foreclose it (filed as #703, since closing
    it means changing what SKILL.md asks agents to pass, not adding a rule). Widening is welcome;
    it has to turn this red first and move the sentence in .gitignore with it.

    One clause of the round that shipped this docstring is RETRACTED here: it said
    `browser_network_request` (singular) "was never exercised here" and counted it among the six
    by its own schema rather than by observation. The same round's second pass then drove exactly
    that tool with `part: "response-body"` plus a `filename` and landed a GIF and a ZIP in a probe
    checkout's root — recorded above at `BROWSER_BINARY_SIGNATURES`, i.e. the file contradicted
    itself as shipped. That writer is observed, not inferred.

    reasoned.** An earlier draft of this docstring said three formats were "the whole binary
    surface"; the card's second pass disproved it by construction, and the counter-example is in
    the default capability set: `browser_network_request(part="response-body", filename=…)`
    writes the raw body of any request the page made, in whatever format the server sent. A GIF
    and a ZIP were dropped into a probe checkout's root as `.bin` files and matched nothing here.
    One more format needs only a capability: `browser_start_video` is absent from the default
    set and present with `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS=devtools`; the WebM it NAMES (`1a45dfa3…`) reaches
    the root of the server's cwd when `browser_stop_video` stops the recording.
    Extending to "any binary" is not the repair — it would mean deciding by bytes which of a
    repo's files are artifacts, which bytes cannot say.

    Candidate set is git's own answer to "what could `git add -A` publish": the index plus
    untracked-and-not-ignored. The index half is what still sees a `git add -f` and a file
    committed before any rule existed, which no ignore pattern can retract.

    Content comes from BOTH copies of a candidate — the UNION, which is VMCP-242 (819) and not
    what shipped here. Until then it read the working tree with a FALLBACK to the index blob: a
    choice, and the fallback fired only where `path.is_file()` was False — usually an absent
    worktree copy, and also a path replaced by a directory or a broken symlink. #630's
    reviewer built the consequence in this same file, one gate over from the one it had just
    argued out — a real PNG committed as `asset.bin`, its worktree copy overwritten with `just
    some text` and NOT staged. `git status --porcelain` says ` M asset.bin`, the index blob still
    starts `89504e470d0a1a0a`, a plain `git commit` publishes the PNG, and this gate said nothing.
    The argument is #630's, verbatim and unchanged by being about pictures instead of cookies:
    `git add -A` stages the WORKTREE bytes and `git commit` publishes the INDEX blob, so neither
    copy alone is "what git would publish". The walk that answers it is shared with the two shape
    scans, so the three gates cannot drift apart by DUPLICATION again — which is a narrower
    promise than "cannot drift", and the narrower one is the true one: the walk carries
    mode-specific branches on both halves, and a mode is a place two gates can still differ.

    A candidate whose bytes cannot be read from EITHER copy is reported as unreadable rather than
    skipped, on the same principle the storage-state scan applies to a file too big to parse.

    Unlike that scan this one needs NO size ceiling, and the contrast is the point: it never
    parses a file, it reads `MAGIC_PREFIX_BYTES` from the front. A credential could be grown past
    a cap; a magic number cannot be hidden by making the file bigger.

    Honest boundary, since this card is about claims outrunning evidence: the same run measured
    browser_snapshot, browser_console_messages, browser_network_requests and browser_evaluate
    writing the page's text and its request query strings into the checkout root under
    caller-chosen names, as plain text with no signature to match. Those are listed in
    EXPLICIT_ARTIFACT_UNCOVERED and are covered by nothing here. And this is a GATE, not a lock:
    red in the pre-push run and in CI, powerless against a `git commit` and blind to a file that
    never reaches this working tree at all.

    Offending PATHS are reported; contents never are.

    MUTATION-CHECKED (`__pycache__` cleared between rounds, exactly 1 test selected per round,
    every probe a REAL artifact copied from this card's own playwright run — PNG 15,580 bytes
    starting `89504e470d0a1a0a`, JPEG 17,255 starting `ffd8ffe0`, PDF 20,220 starting
    `255044462d` — every probe deleted afterwards, and no `git checkout`/`restore` anywhere near
    a tree holding uncommitted work. Reported strings transcribed from the runs:

    * control -> PASS
    * the real screenshot as `vmcp629-shot.bin`, a name NO ignore rule covers and the exact case
      the extension list cannot reach -> FAIL, `['vmcp629-shot.bin (PNG)']`
    * the same bytes as `shot.png`, which IS ignored -> PASS, correctly: `git add -A` cannot
      take it, so it is not in the candidate set
    * that same ignored file then `git add -f`-ed into the index -> FAIL, `['shot.png (PNG)']`.
      The round that proves the index half is not decorative — and it fails
      `test_no_image_or_pdf_asset_is_tracked_today` at the same time, which is the intended
      overlap: an ignore rule cannot retract a tracked path.
    * the real JPEG as `vmcp629-shot.bin` -> FAIL, `['vmcp629-shot.bin (JPEG)']`
    * the real PDF as `vmcp629-shot.bin` -> FAIL, `['vmcp629-shot.bin (PDF)']`
    * a text file whose body merely MENTIONS `%PDF-` and a PNG header rather than starting with
      one -> PASS, so the matcher is anchored at the front and is not a substring search
    * the index-blob branch, built because the second pass found the hole it fills: a real PNG
      `git add -f`-ed as `vmcp629-committed.bin` and then DELETED from the working tree -> FAIL,
      `['vmcp629-committed.bin (PNG)']`, while `test_no_image_or_pdf_asset_is_tracked_today`
      passes on the same state (the name is `.bin`, outside its globs) — so nothing else was
      covering it. Disabling ONLY that branch, on the identical state -> PASS, which is the
      pre-fix behaviour and what makes the branch load-bearing rather than decorative.

    Every round above was run against the INLINE loop this test used to carry, over this
    repository, with probes planted in it and deleted afterwards. That is why none of them found
    #819: the state it is about is a DISAGREEMENT between two copies, and planting one here means
    holding a real screenshot in the repo whose guard forbids it. The scan is a function now and
    the rounds that replace these live beside their pins, on a throwaway clone.

    THE ALLOWANCE IS SUBTRACTED HERE AND NOWHERE INSIDE THE SCANNER, which is what keeps every
    round above and every clone-driven pin below measuring the unchanged detector: the three
    README screenshots ARE reported by `_scan_for_browser_binary_signature` as PNGs, exactly as a
    spilled one would be, and this test drops them BY PATH after the fact. So the sentence the old
    assertion ended on — "this repo has tracked no image or PDF in its history" — is what changed,
    not the scan; `DELIBERATE_IMAGE_ASSETS` and the .gitignore paragraph carry its replacement.
    Subtracting by path also means a PNG that merely LIVES in `docs/images/` under a fourth name
    is still an offender, since the allowance is the enumerated list rather than the directory.

    MUTATION-CHECKED for the allowance, same selection and method as the sibling gate
    (`tests/unit/test_repo_browser_isolation.py`, `__pycache__` deleted per round,
    `collected 124 items` every round, `FAILED ` lines counted): control 0 failed; a real PNG
    copied to a FOURTH name under `docs/images/` and `git add -f`-ed, mutation 2 failed — this
    gate and the tracked-set gate together. Then, holding that same fourth file in place, the
    allowance widened from the three exact paths to the DIRECTORY (`startswith("docs/images/")`),
    control 0 failed; mutation 1 failed — this gate went quiet and only the tracked-set gate was
    left standing, which is the measured reason the allowance is an enumerated list. Closing
    control 0 failed, on the restored tree.

def test_no_image_or_pdf_asset_is_tracked_today():
    """The PRICE argument of #629, pinned — because it is what makes these rules affordable.

    Excluding four whole extensions is only cheap while the repo has nothing of them. Measured
    2026-08-02: `git ls-files` returned nothing for any of them, and `git log --all --name-only`
    — deliberately broader than `--diff-filter=A`, since it reports ANY commit that touched such
    a path on ANY ref rather than only additions — returned nothing either. That is the same
    standing `*.html` above already had when its rule went in.

    The measurement is DATED rather than given as "over N commits", which is how the first draft
    of it read. `git rev-list --all --count` answered 378 and then 379 within the same hour, on
    the same tree, because siblings land while a card is being written — and `--all` counts other
    agents' `task/*` branches too, so it was never the denominator the sentence implied.

    THAT DAY CAME, and this docstring is the update the old wording demanded rather than a
    weakening of it. The public-README pass committed three screenshots of a throwaway demo board
    — `DELIBERATE_IMAGE_ASSETS` — so "this repo has none" stopped being true and the price stopped
    being zero. The old text said what to do about it: rewrite the .gitignore paragraph with the
    new price, which that commit does, in the same commit as this.

    WHAT THE GATE BECAME IS STRICTER IN ONE DIRECTION AND LOOSER IN NO OTHER. It asserts the
    tracked set is EQUAL to that tuple, not a superset of it. Equal, because a subset check would
    only have caught the fourth picture: a deliberate asset DELETED, renamed, or moved leaves the
    tuple describing a repo that no longer exists, and nothing else in the suite reads these paths
    — the README's `<img src>` is prose, and no gate resolves it. So both directions are red here,
    and the tuple stays a description rather than a wish.

    It is deliberately NOT a `docs/images/*` glob. The whole hazard is that a spilled screenshot
    copied into an assets directory looks exactly like a deliberate one, so the allowance is by
    exact path and a fourth image costs an edit to the constant — a decision, recorded where the
    argument about pictures already lives.

    Distinct from the shape scan next door, which needs the file to still START with a magic
    number: this one fires on a tracked `.png` that is empty, truncated or re-encoded, and it
    reads the INDEX, which no ignore rule can retract a path from.

    MUTATION-CHECKED against the PRE-allowance gate (real artifact, `git rm --cached` and delete
    afterwards): control PASS; `git add -f` a real screenshot as `docs/diagram.png` -> FAIL, `git
    now carries ['docs/diagram.png']`; the same forcing under the root name `shot.png` -> FAIL
    naming that instead, which is the round showing this reads the INDEX rather than a fixed path.
    Those rounds pin the READ (index, by glob) and survive the change, because the read is what
    they mutated; what they do NOT reach is the allowance, whose own rounds are recorded below.

    MUTATION-CHECKED for the allowance, selection `tests/unit/test_repo_browser_isolation.py`,
    `__pycache__` deleted before each round, `collected 124 items` every round, counted by lines
    beginning `FAILED ` (never by pytest's `N failed` line, which in this repo reads a mutant's own
    docstring back): control 0 failed; a fourth real PNG `git add -f`-ed under `docs/images/`,
    mutation 2 failed — this gate AND the byte scan next door, the intended overlap. One name
    DROPPED from the tuple while its file stays tracked, control 0 failed; mutation 2 failed —
    also both, and that pair was the correction: it was written as 1 before it was run, because
    dropping a name stops the sibling gate subtracting that path too. One name ADDED that no file
    backs, control 0 failed; mutation 1 failed — this gate alone, since nothing is tracked for the
    byte scan to see. That last round is the one that makes this EQUALITY rather than containment:
    a superset check passes it. Closing control 0 failed, on the restored tree.

def test_every_filename_skill_md_prescribes_is_excluded_by_this_repos_gitignore():
    """#703: the one axis that reaches the TEXT writers, pinned across BOTH files it depends on.

    #629 closed the binary surface with two layers and recorded the residual in prose: the four
    tools that write the page's own text under a caller-chosen name are reachable by neither.
    That was not an oversight in either layer, it is what those layers ARE. An extension list
    cannot help — the names measured were `.md`, `.txt`, `.json` and one with no extension, and
    this repo tracks 7 `.md`, 3 `.json`, a `.yml` and two extensionless files, so any pattern wide
    enough to catch the spill hides the repo's own content. A signature cannot help either: the
    payload is plain text.

    What is left is the DIRECTORY, and it costs one rule that is already there (`.playwright-mcp/`,
    #607) and blind to both name and format. So the fix is a change to what SKILL.md tells agents
    to PASS — which is why #629 refused to make it and filed this card instead.

    A prescription is a sentence, and this repo's own .gitignore says what a sentence of discipline
    is worth. This is the mechanism under it, and it is deliberately a CROSS-FILE pin rather than a
    string match: it takes every `filename` value SKILL.md prints and asks GIT whether this repo
    would publish it. It therefore goes red from EITHER side — a rulebook that drifts back to a
    bare name, or a `.gitignore` that stops covering the directory the rulebook now depends on.

    WHAT IT CANNOT DO — found by an independent pass that BUILT the evasion rather than arguing it,
    and re-measured here. The pin sees only a prescription written in a spelling
    `PRESCRIBED_FILENAME_RE` matches. Same clone, same selection, control 0 failed: against the
    first version of the pattern (`filename=` alone) a rule added to SKILL.md as
    `{"filename": "vmcp-703-console.txt"}` — a bare name, and the form an MCP argument literally
    takes — measured 0 failed, i.e. the rulebook prescribed the leaking form and nothing went red;
    with the pattern as it now stands, the identical edit measured 1 failed. It covers that form,
    spaces around the separator and a line wrap after it (this file is hand-wrapped, so the wrap is
    an editing accident, not an attack), and it remains a pattern over PROSE: a value that reaches
    an agent by some other spelling reaches this pin by none. Same class one level up, also built:
    a sentence AFTER the pinned clauses that contradicts them ("if the directory is missing, just
    pass a bare name") leaves everything here green. These are gates on the text this repo ships,
    not proofs about what an agent will do with it.

    The last two assertions are what keep the pin from decorating, and BOTH exist because the
    sweep below disproved a predicted round. The git-backed checks alone were measured GREEN when
    the prefix was stripped from the screenshot example — correctly, since `*.png` covers that name
    in any directory, so "would git publish it" simply cannot see the drift. Hence one assertion on
    the RULE as SKILL.md states it (every prescribed value under the output dir), and one on the
    EXAMPLES (at least one whose bare basename git WOULD publish, i.e. one the directory alone
    saves — the `.md` snapshot, which is the case this whole card is about). Without the second, a
    rulebook whose examples had drifted to screenshots only would keep this pin green while
    teaching agents nothing #629 had not already covered.

    Honest boundary, stated because this card's family is claims outrunning evidence. This holds
    the RULE, not the behaviour: an agent that passes a bare name still spills, and for the TEXT
    writers nothing detects it — the magic-byte scan above does catch a bare-named PNG/JPEG/PDF,
    which is precisely the half #629 could close and this one cannot. The spill is not even
    root-confined: measured, a `filename` carrying a subdirectory landed beside the sources. It is
    also local twice over. `.playwright-mcp/` is ignored in THIS repo, while SKILL.md self-heals
    onto consumers whose .gitignore this pin cannot see; and the directory itself is relative to
    the MCP server's WORKSPACE, which is the first root the client declares (`clientInfo.cwd =
    firstRootPath(clientRoots)`), falling back to the server's cwd only when a client declares
    none. For the session's shared browser those coincide with the main checkout — which is how
    #554 measured the artifact landing there, and what the `mkdir` recipe in SKILL.md resolves —
    but "the checkout" is a consequence of that setup, not a property of the tool. What the pin
    buys is that the rulebook no longer PRESCRIBES the leaking form, and that the form it does
    prescribe is checked against the rules of the repository that ships it.

    MUTATION-CHECKED in a `git clone --no-hardlinks` of this branch (never a `cp -R`, which drags
    `.venv` and puts the ORIGINAL `src` earlier on `sys.path`, after which every round is green);
    `vikunja_mcp.__file__` printed each round and confirmed to be the CLONE's;
    `__pycache__` deleted before each round AND `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, since that variable
    stops Python writing bytecode, not reading a stale `.pyc`; sources restored from a COPY.
    Selection is BOTH rulebook-facing files (`test_repo_browser_isolation.py` +
    `test_skill_contract.py`, 112 tests) so a round's effect on the contract pins next door is
    visible rather than hidden by a narrow selection. Failed counts, never pass totals:

    * control 0 failed
    * strip the `.playwright-mcp/` prefix from BOTH prescribed calls in SKILL.md -> 1 failed, this
      test, naming `vmcp-554-snap.md` as unignored (`vmcp-554-probe.png` is NOT named: `*.png`
      covers it wherever it sits)
    * strip the prefix from the `.md` call ONLY -> 1 failed, same message: the case no extension
      rule can cover is caught on its own
    * strip the prefix from the `.png` call ONLY -> 1 failed, on the RULE assertion, naming
      `vmcp-554-probe.png` as prescribed outside the output dir. PREDICTED as a failure of the
      git-backed check and MEASURED, before that assertion existed, as **0 failed** — the round
      that added it. A pin that only asks git cannot see a screenshot drifting back to a root path
    * swap the prefix for a directory this repo does NOT ignore (`docs/`) -> 1 failed, naming
      `docs/vmcp-554-snap.md` as publishable: the round that shows this is not a string match on
      one blessed path but a question put to git
    * make BOTH prescribed examples `.png` -> 1 failed, on the EXAMPLES assertion (`assert []`):
      every value stays ignored and every value stays under the output dir, yet nothing left in
      the rulebook demonstrates the writer this card exists for
    * delete the `.playwright-mcp/` line from .gitignore -> 2 failed: this test (both prescribed
      values now unignored) and #607's `test_the_playwright_output_dir_is_excluded`. The round
      that shows the pin reaches the ignore rules and not only the prose
    * break the regex so it matches nothing -> 1 failed on the floor, not a silent green
    * add a THIRD correctly-prefixed prescription -> 0 failed: writing another rule is not a test
      edit

    And the rounds that land next door, on the contract pins this card also moved (same selection,
    control 0 failed): gut the prefix INSTRUCTION while leaving both example values intact -> 1
    failed, `test_the_shared_browser_rule_stays_detectable_rather_than_wishful` — the round that
    matters most here, since the values alone would keep THIS test green; drop the mkdir/ENOENT
    precondition -> 1 failed, same id; revert the `attach_file` clause to its pre-#703 root path
    -> 1 failed, same id.

    ============================================================================================
    #736: THE SECOND DOOR INTO THE SAME DIRECTORY, gated by the second half of this test.

    The name of this test still says `filename`, and that is now narrower than what it checks —
    kept deliberately, because the name is quoted in four places (.gitignore, CLAUDE.md and two
    docstrings in test_skill_contract.py) and a rename buys nothing a sentence cannot. What it
    checks is BOTH routes SKILL.md prescribes today — a caller-chosen `filename` and
    `--output-dir` — each in the spellings its own pattern matches. Not "every path": the browser
    has other flags that write, and one this rulebook never prints is one this pin never sees.

    #703 fixed the caller-chosen `filename`. Beside it stood the recipe that launches an agent's
    own server — `--output-dir <каталог с id задачи>` — untouched by that card and feeding the
    OTHER resolver, `outputFile()`, which is where the AUTO-named artifacts go. One of them is
    `page-*.yml`, the aria snapshot, i.e. the page's own text: the exact payload #703 exists for,
    arriving through a door #703 did not close. The placeholder reads equally as a subdirectory of
    the worktree and as one of the scratchpad, and only the second reading was safe.

    Reproduced BEFORE the fix, not argued (constants above carry the full measurement): with
    `--output-dir 736-out` git reported `?? 736-out/` and `git add -A --dry-run` STAGED the `.yml`
    and the `.log`, both carrying markers planted on the probe page — including a link's `?token=`
    query string. Only the screenshot was covered, by #629's `*.png`.

    MUTATION-CHECKED with the same discipline as the rounds above (`git clone --no-hardlinks` of
    this branch; `__pycache__` deleted each round AND `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`;
    `vikunja_mcp.__file__` printed and confirmed to be the CLONE's; sources restored from a COPY
    and `git status --porcelain` confirmed EMPTY after every round; `collected 115 items` printed
    and cross-checked against the count of `^FAILED` lines each time). Failed counts, never pass
    totals:

    * control 0 failed
    * revert the recipe to the old `<каталог с id задачи>` placeholder -> 1 failed, this test.
      The round this card exists for
    * point the recipe at `554-out`, a plain directory named after the task -> 1 failed
    * point it at `dist/554` — ignored HERE, but for an unrelated reason -> 1 failed, and on the
      RULE assertion, with the git-backed check GREEN. That measurement is why the rule assertion
      is separate rather than folded in, exactly as #703 found for the screenshot example
    * delete the `.playwright-mcp/` line from .gitignore -> 2 failed: this test and #607's
      `test_the_playwright_output_dir_is_excluded`. The pin reaches the ignore rules, not only
      the prose
    * break `PRESCRIBED_OUTPUT_DIR_RE` so it matches nothing -> 1 failed on the floor
    * add a THIRD correctly-prefixed value -> 0 failed: writing another rule is not a test edit
    * narrow `AUTO_NAMED_PROBES` to the screenshot AND drift the recipe to `554-out` -> 1 failed,
      but on the RULE assertion: `*.png` is directory-blind, so the git-backed half went blind
      with it. See that constant — the round corrected an overclaim in its own comment
    * remove the negative lookahead the regex was written with -> **0 failed**. It was dead code:
      `\\s+` already refuses to start a value where a backtick follows the flag. Removed, and the
      comment that credited it rewritten
    * unbacktick ONE prose mention of the flag -> 1 failed. A FALSE red, kept as the honest
      residual: this reads prose, and prose punctuation can hand it a Russian word as a path
    * rewrite the recipe in the EQUALS spelling with a bad directory (`--output-dir=554-out`) ->
      1 failed. Against the pattern as first written (`\\s+` only) the same round measured **0
      failed** — the bypass an attack pass BUILT, after first measuring on the server that the
      equals form spills identically. See PRESCRIBED_OUTPUT_DIR_RE
    * the equals spelling with the CORRECT directory -> 0 failed: the widened pattern costs no
      false red
    * set the floor to 2 AND delete the flag from the fence -> 2 failed, one of them the floor.
      The round that disproved a COUNTERFACTUAL this docstring's neighbour had asserted as
      measured; see MIN_PRESCRIBED_OUTPUT_DIRS

    THE ROUND THAT CHANGED THE FIX, and the reason a sweep is run instead of predicted (same
    selection, control 0 failed): delete
    `--output-dir` from the FENCED launch line entirely, leaving the several prose mentions of the
    flag alone -> **0 failed**. Everything here stayed green while the line an agent copies had
    lost the flag — because this pin asks whether git would publish each value the file PRINTS,
    and a prose restatement is still a value. That is the same defect #703's neighbour recorded
    for `--isolated` and `--channel=chrome`, so it was closed where those are: one assertion in
    `test_the_browser_answer_leads_with_the_isolation_an_agent_can_launch_itself`, matching INSIDE
    the fence. Re-run after it -> 1 failed, there. What that assertion guards is the NAMING rule
    and not a leak — the first version of it claimed a leak, and an independent attack pass
    disproved that by running the server with no `--output-dir` at all: the DEFAULT output dir is
    `<cwd>/.playwright-mcp/`, the ignored one, `git status` empty and `git add -A --dry-run`
    staging nothing. Re-measured here. Its own comment carries the correction.

    HONEST BOUNDARY, and it is not the same one #703 has. Two facts measured for this card:
    `--output-dir` pointed OUTSIDE the repo WORKS — there is no `File access denied … outside
    allowed roots` here, because that refusal belongs to the caller-chosen `filename` path and
    `--output-dir` defines a root rather than escaping one. So "outside the repo" is a genuine
    second answer, and SKILL.md says so; it is not the prescribed one, and this pin cannot check
    it, because a directory outside the repository has no path to put to git. And the directory
    appears on the first `browser_navigate` — measured absent at server start and absent after
    `initialize`, present after that one call —
    which is what makes a caller-chosen `filename` under the same prefix work with no manual
    `mkdir -p` in the measured order, and is a fact about ordering rather than a guarantee.
    Everything the #703 boundary above says still applies unchanged: this holds the RULE, not the
    behaviour; `.playwright-mcp/` is ignored in THIS repo while SKILL.md self-heals onto consumers
    whose .gitignore no pin here can see; and a flag this rulebook never prints is a flag this
    pin never sees.

    ============================== #751 ========================================================
    #751: THE THIRD DOOR — a CONFIG FILE — gated by the third block of this test.

    `--config <path>` with `{"outputDir": …}` sets the same directory the flag sets, and the same
    two text artifacts spill from it. Reproduced before the fix rather than argued (the constant
    PRESCRIBED_CONFIG_OUTPUT_DIR_RE carries the full measurement): `git status` showed
    `?? cfg-out-751/` and `git add -A --dry-run` staged the `.yml` and the `.log`, the first
    carrying the probe page's aria text and a link's `?token=` query string.

    THE CARD'S OWN FRAME WAS THE FIRST THING TO GO, and re-measuring is what did it. It was filed
    as "the THIRD door", and the doors number at least FIVE: beside the flag in both spellings and
    the config file, `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR` and `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG` set the same
    directory with NO flag on the line — both measured spilling identically. Enumerating flags can
    therefore never close this, which is why the
    prescription and this pin are about a DIRECTORY. Against that, the fact that bounds the
    exposure, also measured: the explicit `--output-dir` BEATS all three (pairwise, each round
    put the files in `.playwright-mcp/751` and never created the foreign directory), so the
    recipe is safe from a stray config and an inherited env var as long as it keeps its flag —
    which the fence assertion in test_skill_contract.py holds. What is left is the agent that
    drops the flag and configures instead.

    MUTATION-CHECKED in a separate clone with this file's usual discipline (`git clone
    --no-hardlinks`; `__pycache__` deleted each round AND `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`;
    `vikunja_mcp.__file__` printed and confirmed to be the CLONE's; every mutation asserted to
    have LANDED before the round and the sources restored from a copy after it). Failed counts,
    never pass totals, and the control is in this same paragraph rather than assumed:

    READ THE ASSERTION, NOT THE COUNT, for the first three rounds — and that is a correction this
    card made to its own first draft rather than a style note. All three blocks of this test are
    assertions inside ONE test function, so pytest stops at the first one that fires and the
    round count is 1 whichever of them did. Against control 0 failed, a draft of this list
    predicted 2 failed for the first round below, reasoning that two assertions were violated;
    both ARE, and the round still measures 1 failed. So every round here was re-run printing the
    AssertionError, and what is recorded is which assertion spoke:

    * control 0 failed
    * point the prescribed `outputDir` at `cfg-out-751`, a plain directory in the tree -> 1
      failed, on the GIT-BACKED assertion, naming both text probes under that directory
    * point it at `dist/751` — ignored HERE, for an unrelated reason -> 1 failed, on the RULE
      assertion, with the git-backed one reached and GREEN. The same measurement that made #703
      and #736 each keep their two assertions separate, reproduced for this door not inherited
    * break PRESCRIBED_CONFIG_OUTPUT_DIR_RE so it matches nothing -> 1 failed, on the floor
    * delete the `.playwright-mcp/` line from .gitignore -> 2 failed, and here the count DOES
      mean two: this test and #607's `test_the_playwright_output_dir_is_excluded`, which is a
      different test function. This block reaches the ignore rules and not only the prose
    * delete the whole `--config` bullet from SKILL.md -> 1 failed, on the floor: the rulebook
      cannot drift back to silence about this door without going red
    * control again 0 failed

    FALSE REDS PRICED BEFORE LANDING, on the tree as it stands: the new pattern finds exactly one
    value in SKILL.md (`.playwright-mcp/<id>`), which is the only file this pin reads, and the
    existing `--output-dir` pattern still finds the same two values it found before — the
    `--config` paragraph names the equals spelling as `` `--output-dir=` ``, where the closing
    BACKTICK is the next character, so `[^\\s`]+` never starts a value there. Run over every
    tracked file, the new pattern has exactly one other hit in the whole repository — the
    `"<value>"` written in this file's own comment to show the spelling — and it costs nothing,
    because no pin reads this file for prescriptions. That second half was checked rather than
    assumed: a draft of this paragraph claimed the pattern matched nowhere else at all.
    Whole unit suite 1004 passed, ruff clean, `uv sync --locked` clean.

    BOUNDARY, and it is a real one rather than a hedge: the two ENV VARS are beyond ANY pin over
    prose. They are not written on the launch line at all — they are inherited from whoever
    started the agent — so nothing this file reads can see them, and the only defence against
    them is the flag the recipe carries. SKILL.md says exactly that instead of implying coverage
    it does not have.

def _publishable_copies(root: Path, *, prefix: int | None = None):
    """Every copy of every path `git add -A` could publish, yielded as `(rel, size, raw)`.

    ONE walk, shared by all THREE scans below rather than written three times — VMCP-209 (752)
    extracted it unchanged from the storage-state scan, VMCP-242 (819) brought the magic-bytes
    scan onto it. The classifier is the easy half; the
    subtle half is WHICH BYTES count as publishable, and that took VMCP-141 (630) plus its
    reviewer two rounds to get right. A second hand-written copy would be the one nobody
    re-measured, and the two gates would drift apart in silence — which is not a worry, it is
    what happened: the magic-bytes scan kept its own inline copy, that copy read the worktree
    with a FALLBACK to the index rather than the union, and it stayed that way through #630's
    whole two-round argument in the same file. #630's own record of what a duplicated loop costs
    is next door: the first version of its pins measured the copy, so the real mutation came back
    green.

    `raw` is `b""` when `size` exceeds `SHAPE_SCAN_MAX_BYTES`; the caller decides what to do
    with a candidate it cannot afford to read, and both shape callers REPORT rather than skip.

    PREFIX MODE (`prefix=N`) changes two things for the magic-bytes caller, and both are the
    difference between the two questions rather than taste. It reads at most N bytes from each
    copy and applies NO ceiling: `SHAPE_SCAN_MAX_BYTES` exists because a `json.loads` can be
    handed an unbounded file, and a fixed prefix cannot — a magic number is not hidden by
    growing the file, so blanking a large candidate here would invent a blind spot instead of
    closing one. And it yields `raw=None` for a copy whose bytes could not be read, so
    "could not look" stays distinguishable from "looked and found nothing"; in the default mode
    such a copy is dropped silently, exactly as it was before this parameter existed.

    A GITLINK (index mode 160000) is not a candidate for its INDEX half — VMCP-248 (839). The
    entry names a COMMIT, so there are no bytes there for `git add -A` to publish as content, and
    both index reads refuse it: the magic-bytes caller then reported the submodule in
    `unreadable`, saying "format UNKNOWN" of a thing that has no format. That made this file RED
    in any checkout carrying a submodule, and this repository escaped only by having none —
    measured at `4f1dae7`, `git ls-files -s | awk '$1=="160000"'` is empty, which is the right
    evidence because a gitlink lives in the INDEX and `.gitmodules` is merely a file. Dropped by
    MODE, and the object-TYPE spelling that looks equivalent is not: an ordinary submodule's
    commit lives in the SUBMODULE's object store, so from up here `cat-file -t :./sub` cannot
    name a type at all and a type filter leaves the submodule reported exactly as before, while
    additionally reddening both rows of
    `test_an_index_entry_whose_OBJECT_IS_NOT_A_BLOB_is_reported`.

    THE WORKTREE HALF IS DELIBERATELY KEPT, which is why this cuts at the index read instead of
    subtracting gitlinks from `tracked`. For an ordinary submodule that costs nothing — the path
    is a DIRECTORY, `is_file()` is False, and nothing is yielded either way. But a gitlink whose
    working copy is a plain FILE is real and PUBLISHABLE, and it was built rather than reasoned
    about (git 2.50.1): replace the submodule directory with a file of PNG bytes and git reports
    ` T`, `git add -A --dry-run` answers `add 'sub'`, and the shipped scan names it a PNG
    offender. `ls-files --others` does NOT list that path, so subtracting from `tracked` would
    have dropped it from the walk entirely and lost a catch this gate has today.

    What no version of this reaches is the submodule's CONTENT — a BORDER, not a gap. A
    superproject does not publish the bytes of files inside a live gitlink, measured four ways: a
    PNG under `sub/` uncommitted, the same PNG committed inside the submodule, and the submodule
    with its own `.git` deleted all leave `git add -A --dry-run` empty up here. The natural
    counter-example completes it rather than breaking it — `git rm --cached sub` makes `sub/` an
    ordinary untracked directory, and that same PNG is caught. So the moment those bytes become
    publishable there is no gitlink left, and dropping mode 160000 costs no coverage. A submodule
    is its own repository with its own gate; this one cannot cover its content and does not
    pretend to.

    TRACKED and UNTRACKED are kept apart, which VMCP-141 (630) is about. The candidate LIST
    always came from git; the BYTES came from the worktree, and where the two disagree the scan
    went quiet. Built rather than reasoned about, on a clean clone: a shaped file `git add -f`ed
    and then DELETED from the worktree -> 1 passed; the worktree copy overwritten with `{}`
    while the index blob stayed a cookie -> 1 passed; committed and then deleted locally without
    committing the deletion (` D` in status) -> 1 passed. In all three `git cat-file -p :<path>`
    still hands out the credential. CI never saw it (a fresh checkout is clean, and there the
    index half IS the whole scan), which is why this is a hardening rather than a leak — but the
    local run was claiming a guarantee it did not have.

    EVERY copy of one candidate is yielded — the UNION, not a choice. #630's first version READ
    THE INDEX INSTEAD OF THE WORKTREE, and its reviewer measured that this swapped one blind spot
    for a wider one. Both copies matter, for two different commands: for a tracked-and-modified
    path `git add -A` stages the WORKTREE bytes, while `git commit` (with nothing staged)
    publishes the INDEX blob. Reading either alone leaves a real state silent.

    Measured, on a real repo, with the index-only version: a committed benign `package.json`
    whose worktree copy was overwritten with a credential and NOT staged — `git status` says
    ` M`, `git add -A --dry-run` says `add 'package.json'`, and the scan reported NOTHING,
    while the ORIGINAL worktree-only scan caught it. That state is also more reachable than the
    three above — but the reason this docstring gave for it, that those "need a deliberate
    `git add -f`", was false, and VMCP-241 (817) replaced it with the measured one. It is the
    INDEX that separates them, not a flag: what the three need is the shaped file STAGED — one
    plain `git add`, plus a `git commit` for the committed-then-deleted row — against ZERO git
    commands for an overwrite of a file the repo already tracks. Built on a fresh repository
    carrying this repo's real `.gitignore`: `git add tracker-login.json` is rc 0 and all three
    states assemble from it and are caught. `-f` is what an IGNORED name costs, and only for a
    path git does not YET track — `git add auth.json` there is rc 1 with git's own "Use -f"
    hint, while that same name once TRACKED takes a plain `git add` at rc 0, ignore rules
    having no say over a path git already carries. And that state the gate CATCHES rather than
    lets past: force-added on the same stand and then blanked in the worktree, a shaped
    `auth.json` comes back as an offender, the index half being immune to ignore rules. It is
    just not the state these rows are built from — `git check-ignore --no-index` exits non-zero
    on `tracker-login.json` and on `package.json` alike, and `--no-index` is load-bearing: a
    bare one answers rc 1 for ANY tracked path, so it cannot tell "no pattern" from "tracked".

    The `-f` in `_stage` below is therefore carrying no weight for these rows. Measured on this
    file as the selection, with `collected` cross-checked against the control every round:
    control 0 failed, and dropping `-f` from `_stage` is also 0 failed. Do NOT read the
    fixture's missing `.gitignore` as the REASON, which is the shape a first draft of this
    paragraph had and the second independent pass broke: `git add` refuses on ANY ignore source,
    and a `core.excludesFile` or a `.git/info/exclude` naming one of these paths makes it refuse
    in a repo holding no `.gitignore` at all — both built. So what the round establishes is that
    no ignore rule reaches these names on the machines this suite runs on, which is a property
    of the MACHINE and not of the fixture. The flag is cheap insurance, not dead weight:
    deleting it would move this file's greenness onto whoever's global git config.

    as a FALLBACK — a choice, not a union, so a committed PNG whose worktree copy is overwritten
    with text passed in SILENCE while `git commit` published the PNG.

    Taking a `root` is what lets the rounds below drive the SHIPPED scanner over a throwaway
    clone, the same move #630 made for the storage-state scan and for the same recorded reason.
    **What that buys is HONESTY, not possibility, and the second pass over this docstring
    disproved the stronger claim it first made.** The inline loop was drivable too: import the
    module, reassign the module-level `REPO_ROOT`, call the shipped test function — which is
    exactly what #819's filer did, and what the round in the pin below re-does. A pin of that
    shape would have caught this. What a parameter changes is that the subject is passed in
    rather than monkeypatched, so a round cannot silently measure a copy while the shipped code
    goes untouched.

    `unreadable` is a candidate for which a read was ATTEMPTED on both copies and answered by
    neither, which is narrower than "came back from neither" and is the narrower one on purpose.
    THREE states are outside it, and each is a decision rather than an oversight. An EMPTY file is
    yielded by nothing and reported as nothing: no signature to match, and no page content for
    git to publish. An UNTRACKED candidate that vanished between `git ls-files` and the read is
    likewise nothing — that is the old loop's `else: continue  # untracked and already gone:
    nothing git could publish either`, kept as behaviour once this sentence stopped saying so.
    The third is a GITLINK, and it is the one that was WRONG rather than merely quiet: an index
    entry of mode 160000 names a commit, not bytes, so "could not look" was never the right
    answer about it — VMCP-248 (839). The walk drops that entry's index half; the reasoning, the

    """Layer two: the guard that does NOT depend on the name, and the reason the card shipped.

    A name list forecloses names somebody thought of. This forecloses the SHAPE. Playwright's
    storage state is a JSON object with two list-valued keys, `cookies` and `origins`
    (measured off a real 455-byte export; cookie entries carry name/value/domain/path/
    expires/httpOnly/secure/sameSite). Any file of that shape is a credential regardless of
    what it is called, so `tracker-login.json` — the exact name the ignore list cannot
    safely cover — is caught here.

    The candidate set is git's own answer to "what would `git add -A` publish": the index
    (`ls-files`, which already includes anything staged) plus untracked-and-not-ignored
    (`ls-files --others --exclude-standard`). Using `--exclude-standard` is deliberate and not
    a weakening: a path some machine's global ignore hides is a path `git add -A` will not
    take on that machine either, so the scan's scope tracks the actual risk. The index half is
    immune to ignore rules altogether, which is what makes this also cover the two cases the
    name layer structurally cannot — a `git add -f`, and a file committed before any rule
    existed. In CI, where the checkout is clean, the index half is the whole scan.

    Size is the axis this test got WRONG on its first outing, and the fix is in
    `SHAPE_SCAN_MAX_BYTES`: the ceiling on a single read is a cost bound, not a statement that
    credentials are small, so a candidate above it is REPORTED as unclassified rather than
    skipped. There is no size at which this scan quietly stops looking, because there is no
    size above which a storage state stops being one.

    Honest boundary, stated because this card is about claims outrunning evidence: this is a
    GATE, not a lock. It goes red in the pre-push `uv run pytest tests/unit -q` the
    integration recipe already requires, and in CI. It does not stop `git commit`, and it
    cannot see a file that never reaches this working tree.

    Offending PATHS are reported; contents never are. Reading one to classify it is
    unavoidable, printing it would defeat the purpose.

    MUTATION-CHECKED (`__pycache__` cleared, exactly 1 test selected per round, no
    `git checkout --` anywhere near an untracked subject; every probe synthetic, every probe
    deleted): control PASS; write a real storage-state-shaped file (synthetic values) as
    `tracker-login.json`, which NO ignore rule covers -> FAIL naming that path; the same content
    under `state.json`, which IS ignored -> PASS, correctly, since `git add -A` cannot take it;
    that same ignored file then `git add -f`-ed into the index -> FAIL, the round that proves
    the index half is not decorative; a non-storage-state JSON object carrying only one of the
    two keys -> PASS, so the matcher is not "any JSON".

    And the rounds that hold the size axis, all built rather than reasoned about:

    * the same shape grown to 4,194,662 bytes by one 4 MiB localStorage entry (well inside a
      single origin's quota), still `?? tracker-login.json` -> FAIL. Against the code as it
      stood, with `SHAPE_SCAN_MAX_BYTES = 1 << 20`, that same file measured `1 passed`, and
      flipping ONLY that constant to `1 << 30` measured FAIL: the ceiling, alone, was what let
      it through. The guard was evadable by making the file BIGGER.
    * the same shape grown PAST the ceiling (67,109,154 bytes) -> FAIL, on the second
      assertion, naming it unclassified. That is the round the old code could not produce at
      all: it reported nothing.
    * the 4 MiB file again with the ceiling put BACK to `1 << 20`, nothing else touched -> still
      FAIL, and the message measured is "could NOT be classified", i.e. the file crossed from
      `offenders` to `unclassified` and the verdict did not move. Predicted PASS, measured FAIL,
      and the measurement is the stronger statement: there is no value of the ceiling at which
      this file goes quiet. Lowering it trades a precise finding for a vague one, never for
      silence — which is the whole repair, since the ceiling is now about what the scan can
      afford to read and not about how big a credential can be.
    * a large file that is NOT of the shape gets no special case: above the ceiling it is
      reported too, because not reading it is exactly why its shape is unknown. The remedy the
      message gives (`.gitignore` it) also removes it from `git add -A`'s reach, so the noise
      resolves in the same direction as the guard.

def test_no_file_of_browser_text_artifact_shape_is_reachable_by_git():
    """The lock the TEXT artifacts did not have — VMCP-209 (752), filed off #736's review.

    THE ASYMMETRY THIS CLOSES. A screenshot is held by its leading magic bytes under any name
    (#629) and a storage state by its two list-valued keys, both independently of what the file
    is called. The browser's text output had neither: it was held only by rules over PROSE —
    #703 pins the `filename` SKILL.md prints, #736 the `--output-dir` it prints, #751 the
    `--config` it prints — and every one of those pins asks what the RULEBOOK SAYS, never what
    is on disk. #751 is the proof that this matters: `--config '{"outputDir": …}'` moved every
    auto-named artifact past both existing pins, and closing that ROUTE left the CLASS open, one
    undocumented flag wide.

    WHAT IT MATCHES, and why a whole-file grammar rather than a marker grep. Each shape demands
    that EVERY non-blank line match, over a floor of lines, so the question answered is "is this
    file an artifact" and not "does this file mention one". That is the same move the
    storage-state gate makes by parsing JSON instead of grepping for `"cookies"`, and it is what
    lets this gate coexist with the paragraphs — in `.gitignore`, in CLAUDE.md, in this very
    file — that quote the shapes in order to describe them. The alternative was measured, not
    assumed: see the next test, where the naive grep is red on arrival and this is not.

    MEASURED FALSE REDS OVER THIS REPO: zero, for all three grammars, over the candidate set
    `_publishable_copies` yields (73 tracked + 0 untracked-and-not-ignored at the time of
    writing, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` being the only `.yml` and this file the densest quoter
    of the shapes). That number is what made the lock landable rather than a nuisance, and it is
    re-derived on every run by the pin below rather than trusted from this sentence.

    STILL ZERO AFTER VMCP-237 (798), which is the half of that card that had to be checked and
    not the half that motivated it: 73 tracked + 0 untracked, 139 copies, zero classified. The
    card was filed as HEADROOM — console had no evidence floor at all and neither console nor
    network had a false-red frontier row — and 798 found a live false NEGATIVE underneath it, so
    both grammars moved in BOTH directions at once. What that means for this number is worth
    saying plainly, because "we widened it and false reds stayed at zero" is the sentence a gate
    dies of: the widening (continuation lines, a two-line header block) really does make the
    console grammar weaker, and what holds the zero is not the line shapes but
    `CONSOLE_MIN_LOCATION_LINES`. Priced against prose built to attack it rather than against
    this tree alone — see the frontier rows.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT REACH, measured rather than conceded. `browser_evaluate` writes whatever
    the evaluated JS returned — its measured output is a JSON string literal — so it has no
    grammar, and no version of this gate could give it one. That is the one place CLAUDE.md's
    retired "indistinguishable from a legitimate file" is still exactly right, and it is now
    said of ONE writer instead of four. The two EMPTY forms (a console export with no messages,
    a network export with only its trailing note) are also unclassified, and correctly: an
    artifact with no messages in it has no page content to leak.

    Same honest boundary as its sibling: this is a GATE — red in the pre-push `uv run pytest
    tests/unit -q` and red in CI — not a lock on `git commit`, and it cannot see a file that
    never reaches this working tree. A candidate above `SHAPE_SCAN_MAX_BYTES` is REPORTED rather
    than skipped, for the reason that constant documents at length. Offending PATHS are named;
    contents never are.

    """The measurement that chose the design — VMCP-209 (752), and it only became visible when
    this card landed.

    `.gitignore` recorded the content axis as "considered and dropped", on two grounds. The
    first — that a scan for aria markers "fires on any file that DOCUMENTS it — this comment
    included" — is TRUE of a marker grep and FALSE of a whole-file grammar, and the two answers
    were IDENTICAL (zero hits each) right up until this card, because nothing in the tree quoted
    a `[ref=…]` token yet. The moment fixtures and prose arrive, they diverge: this test is what
    makes the divergence a fact the suite re-derives rather than a claim in a docstring.

    So it asserts the SPLIT, not two numbers: the naive grep must hit at least one legitimate
    file (it will hit this one, and it may hit `.gitignore` and CLAUDE.md as the prose there
    grows), while the shipped grammar hits none. Reading it the other way round is the point —
    a future edit that quotes more artifact text makes the naive number go UP and must leave the
    grammar at zero. The day the grammar stops being zero, the gate above has found something.

    The second ground `.gitignore` gave — "it reaches `browser_snapshot` alone of the four" —
    was narrowed by measurement rather than dropped: three of the four text writers have a
    grammar, and the fourth cannot have one. That is recorded where the classifier lives.

    """The negative half, and every row is a decision rather than an oversight.

    The two EMPTY forms and the `browser_evaluate` dump are measured outputs of the real tool
    that carry no page content — nothing to leak, so classifying them would be pure false-red
    surface. The remaining rows are the false-red frontier from the other side, and each pins
    a DIFFERENT threshold — which is a correction, not a flourish: an earlier version of this
    test claimed the changelog row was held by the line floor, and the sweep disproved it.
    Dropping `ARIA_MIN_ITEM_LINES` from 3 to 1 measured 0 failed, because that row has only ONE
    ref and the REF floor was catching it either way, i.e. the line floor was pinned by nothing.
    Measured after adding the two-line excerpt (selection this file, control 0 failed):
    `ARIA_MIN_REF_LINES` 2 -> 0 kills the bullet-list row, and `ARIA_MIN_ITEM_LINES` 3 -> 1
    kills the excerpt row. Both floors are load-bearing and each has its own witness.

    VMCP-237 (798) gave console and network the same treatment, because they had NEITHER — no
    console floor at all, and not one frontier row between them: their two rows here were both
    false-NEGATIVE decisions. Same selection, `collected 94 items` cross-checked against the
    control on every round, each mutation asserted to have applied, control 0 failed:
    `CONSOLE_MIN_LOCATION_LINES` 2 -> 0 is 2 failed, BOTH console rows at once; 2 -> 1 is 1
    failed, the two-tagged-lines row alone; `NETWORK_MIN_ABSOLUTE_TARGETS` relaxed back to the
    bare `_NETWORK_REQUEST_LINE` is 1 failed, the bare-path row. Three rows for two floors is
    not one spare: the console floor's EXISTENCE and its VALUE are separate claims, and the
    changelog row (no source location at all) survives 2 -> 1 while the two-tagged-lines row
    (exactly one) does not. A single row would have pinned "some floor" and left 1 free.

    THE ROUNDS ARE THE WHOLE ARGUMENT FOR THE VALUE, because both neighbours were built and run
    rather than reasoned about, and they fail in opposite directions. At 1, no real artifact is
    missed and three pieces of constructed prose classify as console — notes opening with a tag
    that quote one console line, a changelog whose last line carries a `@ path:12`, and the
    two-tagged-lines row here. At 3, one real artifact is missed, and at 4, two. A cleverer
    grammar was tried too and lost on the same numbers: requiring every message to CLOSE at a
    location line (which the real output does) still classifies two of those three, because a
    changelog whose final line carries a location closes just as tidily.

    Two deliberate false NEGATIVES, both constructed rather than conceded, and both taken in the
    same direction for the same reason. The aria excerpt row names the first: a genuine snapshot
    of fewer than three lines walks past — the smallest real one produced here was six lines
    with six refs (a snapshot carries the root node and its children, not a fragment), while a
    two-line excerpt in prose is the commoner object by far, and this file, `.gitignore` and
    CLAUDE.md all contain one. The console floor names the second: a real export holding exactly
    ONE message walks past, built and measured in both spellings — timed and header-plus-plain —
    with a two-message one beside it that classifies, so the boundary is the floor and not the
    shape. A missed artifact leaks its lines; a false red on documentation gets the whole gate
    deleted by whoever hits it.

    """#622: the skip must say "not applicable" WITHOUT ever being able to say it about a failure.

    A skip is the one repair that can do more damage than the bug it fixes: 30 red tests are at
    least visible, whereas 30 skipped ones move neither the FAILED count nor `collected` — the two
    numbers a round's verdict is read from here — so the pins go offline while the round reads
    clean. `-q` does print `30 skipped` beside them (#1462), which is why CLAUDE.md now asks for
    that count to be RECORDED and not merely printed. So the two claims `requires_git_checkout`
    makes are asserted here, one per branch, and this test carries no marker — it is the one that
    has to run on BOTH sides of the very condition it is checking.

    In a CHECKOUT: nothing may be skipped (the marker's condition must be false — that is the
    gate's whole value, and an inverted probe would take all 30 pins offline while the suite
    stayed green), and git must actually ANSWER. That second assertion is the trap the card named
    explicitly: a git that is present but broken here — no binary, corrupt repo, unreadable
    objects — is a FAILURE, not a missing repository, and it goes red on this line instead of
    disappearing into a skip. It can only work because the probe reads the filesystem and this
    reads git: one source cannot mask the other. `--show-toplevel` is also required to name
    REPO_ROOT itself rather than some ancestor, which is what would be happening if a `.git` ever
    turned up here belonging to a repo this tree is merely nested inside.

    In a NON-checkout: something must actually be skipped, and the reason has to name the tree —
    a skip whose reason does not say WHICH tree was found wanting is how a measurement
    environment gets misread a second time.

    `is_checkout` is RECOMPUTED here rather than read from `_IS_GIT_CHECKOUT`, and that is the
    whole reason this test can fail at all. Its first version branched on the module constant —
    the thing under test — so inverting the probe merely sent this test down the OTHER branch,
    where every assertion held. Measured, in a real checkout: `11 passed, 30 skipped`, no
    failures: the gate silently offline and the suite green, i.e. precisely the outcome this
    docstring claims to forbid, produced by the round written to prove it could not happen. The
    local `dot_git.exists()` is therefore a SECOND, independent statement of the contract — "the
    marker skips exactly when REPO_ROOT has no `.git`" — and defining the probe some other way
    has to come and reconcile with it here, on purpose.

    MUTATION-CHECKED (`__pycache__` cleared between rounds, the WHOLE file selected per round so
    that the skip count is visible and not just the failure count, source restored from a COPY):
    control PASS in the checkout and PASS in a `git archive` extraction; invert the probe to
    `not (REPO_ROOT / ".git").exists()` -> FAIL in the checkout, the round the first version of
    this test passed; force `_IS_GIT_CHECKOUT = True` inside an extraction -> FAIL; leave the
    constant honest and invert only the MARKER's condition -> FAIL, the round that shows the two
    assertions cover two different mutation sites.

    The last two assertions need a broken TREE rather than a broken source, so they were built:
    a `.git` file pointing at a gitdir that does NOT exist (which takes some doing — see below)
    -> the whole file measures `31 failed, 10 passed, 0 skipped`, i.e. the 30 pins go red exactly
    as they did before this marker existed, plus this one naming the cause, while the 10 that
    pass are precisely the pins that never needed git. Nothing hides in a skip, which is the
    property; and a `.git` file pointing at a repo whose `core.worktree` names a DIFFERENT
    directory -> FAIL on the REPO_ROOT comparison, git having answered exit 0 about that other
    tree. That second one had to be hunted for, and the hunt is the finding: a nested extraction
    does NOT reach it (the probe returns early), and neither does a copied linked worktree — its
    `.git` file still points at a gitdir that EXISTS, and git derives the toplevel from where the
    `.git` file SITS, so `rev-parse` succeeds and names the copy. A dangling gitdir is therefore
    a rarer shape than it first looks (the source repo has to be gone, or on another machine), not
    the ordinary residue of an interrupted worktree operation. Reachable only via `core.worktree`,
    but reachable — which is what stops that line from being an assertion no round can arrive at,
    the kind this file elsewhere calls a claim nobody has tested.

    """The marker has to keep being APPLIED, and remembering is not a mechanism.

    The 30 failures this card removed were not written deliberately — they accumulated, one pin
    at a time, because nothing connected "this test runs git" to "this test needs a checkout".
    Leave that connection to reviewers and the next git-backed pin re-opens the hole for the
    next derived measurement environment to fall into.

    So the rule is enforced from the source: a test function that reaches git — through `_git`,
    `_git_bytes` or `_ignore_rule`, the doors named in `GIT_CALL_MARKERS` — must either carry
    `requires_git_checkout` or branch on `_IS_GIT_CHECKOUT` itself. That the list is a CONSTANT is
    itself load-bearing: #629 added a third door, and a door left out of the list is one this
    scanner cannot see. The second alternative is not a loophole, it is what
    `test_the_checkout_probe_is_not_an_off_switch_for_a_broken_git` needs in order to assert
    anything about the checkout branch at all: it must run unmarked, on both sides.

    The marker is matched as the WHOLE mark, not by its name: an `Mark(name="skipif", …)` with
    some other condition would otherwise satisfy this, and "skipped for an unrelated reason" is
    not the property being enforced. What stays approximate — stated because this file's habit is
    to price its guards rather than round them up — is the escape hatch: `_IS_GIT_CHECKOUT` is
    looked for as a SUBSTRING of the function's source, docstring included, so a test that merely
    mentions the constant in prose while calling git unguarded would pass. That bound is accepted
    rather than engineered away: the hatch exists for exactly one test, taking it is a deliberate
    act by someone editing this file, and the behaviour it protects is held on the checkout side
    by the pin above regardless.

    """The row the record below used to call UNCONSTRUCTIBLE, built — VMCP-242 (819), round 2.

    The claim rested on "`-s` SUCCEEDS and `blob` then fails — both read the same object", and the
    argument is FALSE: reading the same object is not reading it the same way. `cat-file -s` prints
    the size of whatever object the index entry names, of ANY type; `cat-file blob` additionally
    demands that the object BE a blob. So the state needs only an index entry whose OID is not a
    blob, which ONE `git update-index --add --cacheinfo` writes on an OID the fixture already has
    (`--add` is required: without it git exits 128 with "missing --add option?"). Measured on git
    2.50.1, both rows: `-s` rc 0, `blob` rc 128 `fatal: … bad file`, and the SHIPPED scan
    `offenders=[] unreadable=['a.bin']`. What `-s` PRINTS is deliberately not written down — it is
    the size of the tree or commit object it was pointed at, so it moves with the fixture's
    filename, committer identity, message and timezone; the rows assert the two exit codes, which
    are the mechanism, and an independent pass caught this docstring quoting a size measured under
    a different identity than the one the fixture actually uses.

    The branch also CARRIES WEIGHT, which is the half that makes this a pin rather than a
    curiosity. The loop this scan replaced read the blob DIRECTLY and reported a non-zero exit, so
    a shim of the pre-#819 body (`git show ff3d208^:…`) driven over these same two roots answers
    `unreadable=['a.bin']` as well — measured. It reaches that answer by a different ROUTE, so
    what is shared is the report and its cause (the refused blob read), not the walk's path to it.
    Dropping the yield would therefore lose a report this repository had before the card. Not a
    REGRESSION, though, and the distinction is worth keeping: the yield itself shipped in
    `ff3d208`; what was missing was this pin. It is the last UNPINNED half of the index half's two
    could-not-read branches — bounded rather than absolute, because one relaxation elsewhere in
    the walk still kills nothing (`_worktree_copy`'s `if not size: return None` in prefix mode),
    and that one is outside the class: pre-#819 reported nothing in its state either.

    A GITLINK entry pointing at a LOCALLY-PRESENT commit (`--cacheinfo 160000,<commit>,sub`)
    reaches this same branch — measured, `unreadable=['sub']` on both scanner versions — and an
    earlier draft of this docstring called that the ORDINARY submodule. It is not, and the
    correction matters because it moves which BRANCH a submodule is about. Built with a real
    `git submodule add`: the gitlink names a commit living in the SUBMODULE's object store, so the
    superproject's `git cat-file -s :./sub` fails outright — rc 128, `could not get object info` —
    and the walk takes the NEIGHBOURING `-s`-failed branch, the one pinned above. Measured through
    the shipped walk, a real superproject yields `('sub', None, None)` and the scan answers
    `([], ['sub'])`.

    So no gitlink is a row here, for a stronger reason than deference: under the ordinary
    construction a gitlink is not this state at all. Whether a submodule belongs in `unreadable`
    is VMCP-248 (839)'s question, and it sits on that other branch.

    These two rows are corrupt-index shapes, and they survive the fix that card names as its
    EXAMPLE, which was built rather than assumed. Dropping candidates by `ls-files --stage` mode
    160000: the gitlink state stops being reported (`([], [])`) and both of these still report
    `([], ['a.bin'])`, so these rows stay green. They do NOT survive every spelling of the same
    goal, and the counter-shape was built too — drop every candidate whose object TYPE git can
    name and is not a blob, which is where that card's own diagnosis points. Under it both of
    these states report `([], [])`, so both rows go RED, while the neighbouring `-s`-failed pin is
    untouched (`([], ['asset.bin'])`, no type being knowable there). An implementer taking that
    route therefore gets its only signal from this pin and nothing else. That is a real cost of
    pinning now rather than waiting, accepted rather than overlooked: the branch is load-bearing
    today, and what round 1 shipped instead was the branch unpinned with a false argument under it.

#     `test_the_names_that_never_parsed_as_a_stage_are_the_control` and the `[hidden]` row of
#     `test_a_merge_stage_THAT_EXISTS_hands_over_ANOTHER_PATHS_BYTES`. Fourteen of seventeen and
#     not "the index-only rows #820 added" — and the THREE survivors have THREE DIFFERENT reasons,
#     which is why naming one of them was not enough (VMCP-263 (871), whose names and mechanisms
#     are re-derived here by running both cuts and reading the kill sets BY NAME rather than taken
#     from the card — same discipline and the same control as this record's header, and both
#     totals came back unchanged). `[named-falsely]` stages an index-only candidate too and
#     survives, and the
#     reason this bullet used to give — "the answer it expects is carried by a shaped WORKTREE
#     copy" — is TRUE and is half of it: that row's `cred.json` is shaped in the index AND on disk,
#     so EITHER half alone still names it, and measured, it is in NEITHER kill set. `test_a_
#     conflicted_path_with_a_SHAPED_worktree_copy_is_still_caught` is the opposite shape: it cannot
#     fall to THIS cut by construction, being the row that asserts the worktree half covers a path
#     the index half must stay silent on, and it dies to the INDEX cut instead — where, measured,
#     it is exactly the `+1` of the `4 -> 5` step below. So one of the three survivors is PART of
#     the disjointness proof rather than an exception to it, which is the strongest thing this
#     bullet has to say and was the one left unsaid. `test_a_conflicted_entry_leaves_the_SCAN_
#     STANDING` is not about copies at all: it asserts the scan does not RAISE on a conflicted
#     entry and reports nothing, which holds with either half alone, so it too is in neither set.
#     THAT pair is what says the halves are independent rather than one traded for
#     the other: 5 and 24, with no row in both — checked BY NAME over all 29, not inferred from the
#     two totals. The PROPERTY is the durable half and the totals are not — and ONE OF THEM MOVED
#     TWICE, which is what round 2 of this record missed when it handed both shifts to #820.
#     Re-measured for VMCP-251 (849) on one stand across three revisions, control 0 failed at
#     every one of them: the index and worktree cuts are 4 and 8 failed at `972ca81` (#819 round 1,
#     `collected` 103), 5 and 22 failed at `a1b80a6` (#820, 120), and 5 and 24 failed at `9b3a253`
#     (round 2, 122) — the only commits touching this file from the first of those three through
#     the last, so each delta belongs to exactly ONE landing. `4 -> 5` is #820's alone and stopped
#     there. The worktree cut went `8 -> 22` under #820 — the fourteen rows this bullet already
#     accounts for, and the two kill sets differ by exactly those fourteen names — and `22 -> 24`
#     under THIS RECORD'S OWN non-blob pin, whose two rows the decomposition at the head of this
#     bullet already counts inside the 24. Nothing needed running to catch that, and the record
#     held BOTH halves of the disproof: that decomposition puts the pin's two rows inside the 24,
#     and the header calls the pin "this card's own". NEITHER HALF DOES IT ALONE — a pin round 2
#     merely ADDED need not fall to THIS mutation, so the header on its own leaves the attribution
#     unchecked rather than wrong — but together they say the 24 holds rows #820 cannot have
#     contributed, and the two were never read against each other. What DID stay put across all
#     three revisions: the mutations themselves, and the disjointness. And #820 did touch this
#     walk — it rewrote the index half's revspec (`:{rel}` -> `:./{rel}`, two lines) — just not
#     WHICH copies are read, which is the only thing these two rounds are about.
#   * `SHAPE_SCAN_MAX_BYTES` applied in prefix mode on the WORKTREE side -> 1 failed, the
#     `[worktree]` row; on the INDEX side -> 1 failed, the `[index]` row. TWO rounds because the
#     guard is written twice and one probe reaches one site: the second pass over this text
#     measured the index-side guard as UNPINNED while the pin had a single untracked probe, which
#     is why it is parametrised. Why the mode exists at all is the same fact from the other side —
#     reusing the walk unchanged would have blanked a large PNG and turned a correct answer into
#     a refusal to look.
#   * the name-ONCE dedup dropped -> 1 failed, and specifically the `[True]` row, where both
#     copies carry the picture. The `[False]` row cannot fall to it — only one copy is shaped.
#   * the unreadable report replaced by `return offenders, []` -> 4 failed: all three pins that
#     assert a NON-EMPTY `unreadable`, one of them parametrised in two rows. "Non-empty" is
#     load-bearing — a FOURTH test asserts `unreadable == []` (the ceiling pin) and cannot fall to
#     this mutation at all. Round 1 recorded 2 here and named them "both unreadable pins", which
#     the pin added below makes FALSE rather than merely stale: a round carries prose out of date
#     as readily as it carries a count.
#   * the unresolvable-index-entry yield dropped -> 1 failed,
#     `test_a_tracked_candidate_whose_index_object_is_gone_is_reported`. That branch IS this
#     card's own second-pass finding: without it a tracked candidate whose object is gone and
#     whose worktree copy is deleted went from reported (pre-#819, which read the blob directly)
#     to invisible, because `cat-file -s` fails first and the walk's pre-existing
#     conflicted-entry skip swallowed the whole index half.
#   * the index BLOB-read unreadable yield (`elif prefix is not None: yield rel, size, None`)
#     dropped -> 2 failed, both rows of `test_an_index_entry_whose_OBJECT_IS_NOT_A_BLOB_is_reported`
#     above. Round 1 read 0 here and called the state unconstructible, on the argument that
#     reaching it needs `cat-file -s` to succeed on an object `cat-file blob` then refuses, "and
#     both read the same object". The ZERO was honest — the mutation applied and killed nobody —
#     and the ARGUMENT under it was false, which is the harder half to notice: a zero with a
#     mechanism beside it reads as settled. The two commands do read the same object and disagree
#     about its TYPE, so an index entry whose OID is not a blob reaches the branch, and the pin
#     above builds two such entries with one `git update-index --add --cacheinfo` each. Its
#     docstring carries the construction, and why no submodule gitlink is one of its rows: a REAL
#     one fails the SIZE read and lands on the branch one bullet up, not on this one.
#   * `GIT_CALL_MARKERS` losing its `_scan_for_browser_binary_signature(REPO_ROOT` line -> 0
#     failed. Round 1 read that zero as STRUCTURALLY unpinnable and offered a mechanism:
#     `test_every_pin_here_that_shells_out_to_git_declares_it` fires when a test CARRIES a marker
#     and LACKS the decorator, so deleting a door removes the pin from the check's SCOPE instead of
#     breaking the check. That mechanism is real in general and DOES NOT APPLY HERE, and what shows
#     it is the round nobody ran: drop the door line AND the pin's decorator -> 1 failed, the same
#     scanner test. The pin never left the scope. It is named `…_is_reachable_by_git()`, and
#     `_by_git():` carries the older marker `_git(` in the def line itself, so the zero is a SECOND
#     door standing, not an absent one — an inference presented as a mechanism, which is the same
#     defect as the false argument one bullet up and was caught by the same second pass.
#   * so the round from the other side proves less than it appears to: marker KEPT and
#     `@requires_git_checkout` removed from
#     `test_no_file_of_browser_artifact_shape_is_reachable_by_git` -> 1 failed, exactly
#     `test_every_pin_here_that_shells_out_to_git_declares_it` — but the pin's own NAME would have
#     produced that red with the entry deleted too, so it does not attribute the red to the entry.
#     What the entry buys is RENAME INSURANCE, which no round over today's tree can demonstrate;
#     it is argued beside the constant instead.


# --- VMCP-243 (820): `:<rel>` is a REVSPEC, so a leading `<0-3>:` component parses as a stage ---


@pytest.mark.parametrize("name", ["0:cred.json", "1:cred.json", "2:cred.json", "3:cred.json",
                                  "2:dir/cred.json", "0:d/deep/cred.json", "2:"])
def test_a_path_whose_FIRST_COMPONENT_looks_like_a_merge_stage_is_not_a_silent_miss(clone, name):
    """`f":{rel}"` is not a path — it is a REVSPEC, and git parses `:2:cred.json` as "merge stage 2
    of the path `cred.json`", not as the path `2:cred.json`.

    Measured on synthetic repos in the INDEX-ONLY state (`git add -f`, worktree copy deleted), with
    the pre-fix `f":{rel}"`; every row rc=128 with `does not exist` on stderr, `offenders=[]`, a
    SILENT MISS, and every row caught under `:./`:

        '0:cred.json'         '1:cred.json'         '2:cred.json'      '3:cred.json'
        '2:dir/cred.json'     '0:d/deep/cred.json'  '2:'

    The digits are 0-3 because git knows four stages. What the colon has to lead is the FIRST
    PATH COMPONENT, file or DIRECTORY — the last three rows are the half an earlier draft of this
    docstring got wrong, having reasoned that "a `/` before the colon makes the leading component a
    directory" and concluded the defect was confined to files in the ROOT. In `2:dir/cred.json` the
    `/` comes AFTER the colon, the file is two levels down, and it misses exactly the same way; a
    file literally named `2:` misses too, on `fatal: path '' does not exist`. The control test
    below carries `sub/2:cred.json`, which is unaffected because its FIRST component is `sub` — so
    it never bounded this row at all, it merely looked as if it did.

    REACHABILITY IS LOW and this is filed as hardening rather than a leak: it needs a path whose
    first component is literally `2:something`, in a state where the worktree half of the union
    does not already catch it. It is STRICTLY SMALLER than the hole #630 closed, which swallowed
    EVERY index-only state under every name. It is pinned anyway because a `continue` that goes
    quiet on a credential is the class this file grades by what it could hide.

    The fix is one path segment — `f":./{rel}"` — and it is a fix rather than a workaround: `./`
    makes the rest of the string a PATH, so nothing in it can be read as a stage. That resolution
    is relative to CWD, which is also what `ls-files` prints against, so the two halves agree at any
    `root` inside the working tree THE READ RESOLVES AGAINST, top or not — the walk hands both
    commands the same `cwd=root`. Both qualifiers are load-bearing, and each was built rather than
    reasoned. Not "repository": at `root` = the `.git` directory every `:./` read refuses outright,
    `fatal: relative path syntax can't be used outside working tree`, while `ls-files` still lists
    tracked paths (top-relative there) and the bare form answers most of them — 8 of 10 on one
    stand, the two exceptions being the stage-named path this pin is about and a gitlink. `.git` is
    the LOUD member of that boundary rather than its only one: there `ls-files --others` fails
    (`this operation must be run in a work tree`), which the walk's own assert turns into a raise,
    whereas at `.git/modules/<name>` both listings succeed and the walk simply yields `[]` in
    silence. And not "the working tree it sits in" either: point `core.worktree` elsewhere, and a
    cwd that is inside the repository and holds a tracked path still gets that same `:./` refusal
    while bare answers with the bytes. No caller here hands the walk any of these, so the rows bound
    the sentence rather than report a hazard.

    THE DIRECTION THERE IS THE OPPOSITE of what #820 shipped, and the retraction is spelled out
    rather than quietly overwritten, because the false form is still readable in `git log`. This
    docstring used to say the halves "agree for the reason they already had to: `root` is a
    repository TOP at both call sites"; the comment in `_publishable_copies` said it with ONE word
    changed, `TOP in both call sites` — a difference this correction itself first reported as "the
    same", and its own second pass caught, one preposition adrift in the passage whose subject is
    misattribution; and the message of commit `a1b80a6` put it past rescue — "the fix depends on
    `root` being a repository top where the bare form depended on the opposite". A commit message is
    not rewritten here for
    prose (a force-push to main is not that cheap — VMCP-229 (773) records the same call on
    `5389be0`), so that sentence stays wrong where it stands and is RETRACTED here. The
    precondition belongs to the BARE form: `:<rel>` resolves from the repository ROOT, so it agreed
    with a CWD-relative candidate list only where the two coincided. `:./{rel}` REMOVES that
    precondition — it does not acquire one.

    The parenthesis #820 hung on the false claim is itself sound, and now supports the sentence
    instead of refuting it, but it named ONE branch of two. Re-measured on git 2.50.1 (Apple
    Git-155) with `cwd` a SUBDIRECTORY holding an index-only `x.json` — which is the name `ls-files`
    prints there — every row also re-run through THIS walk, `root` pointed at that subdirectory.
    `SHAPED` is a storage state, `benign` is not, and the ROOT copy is tracked wherever it exists:

        ROOT / SUB          bare `:x.json`                    walk bare    walk `:./`
        nothing / shaped    rc=128 `does not exist`           []           ['x.json']
        benign  / shaped    rc=0, 18 B — the ROOT file's      []           ['x.json']
        shaped  / benign    rc=0, 62 B — the ROOT file's      ['x.json']   []

    Across those three rows every `:./` answer is the right one for the subdirectory's own file and
    every bare one is wrong, so off the top the bare form yields the SAME `hidden` / `named-falsely`
    pair this file pins for merge stages, reached along a different axis: a credential hidden in one
    polarity, and in the other a file named as the offender whose own bytes are harmless. "Misses
    EVERY tracked file" was wider than its proof. "Every bare one is wrong" is bounded to the rows
    ON PURPOSE — there is a FOURTH polarity where bare is right BY ACCIDENT, both copies shaped, and
    it agrees with `:./` while still having read the other file.

    WHICH of the two you get is decided not by the presence of a root-level namesake but by what the
    bare revspec resolves to IN THE INDEX — and putting it the short way was this correction's own
    first overclaim, so the routes to the MISS are measured rather than reasoned, listed as a SAMPLE
    and not as a closed set, and only the first is namesake-free. No root entry at all: `does not
    exist`. A root namesake that is present but
    UNTRACKED, or that is a DIRECTORY of that name: the twin is right there and the read still
    fails, `exists on disk, but not in the index`. And a name that ALSO parses as a stage, where the
    two defects COMPOSE — a tracked root `x.json` beside an index-only `sub/2:x.json` gives bare
    `:2:x.json` rc=128 `is in the index, but not at stage 2`, a miss DESPITE the namesake. The
    wrong-BYTES branch is the narrower one, and it was built rather than inferred: the namesake has
    to be in the index at the stage named AND its object has to be a BLOB. Give the root `x.json` a
    live `UU` and that same bare `:2:x.json` exits 0 on THAT path's stage-2 bytes; make the root
    twin a SYMLINK (mode 120000) and bare exits 0 on the length of the link's target PATH, which is
    what a symlink blob holds — ten bytes on that stand, a fact about the name chosen there and not
    about symlinks, so read the mechanism and not the digit — no shape
    scan flags, so the credential hides. A GITLINK (mode 160000) is the counterexample to the tidy
    reading of that rule: in the index at stage 0, a blob it is not, so it MISSES on a fourth
    message again, `could not get object info` — as does a tracked namesake whose loose object has
    been deleted. And the condition is NECESSARY, never sufficient: a tracked but EMPTY root
    namesake resolves perfectly (rc=0, 0 B) and still yields nothing, killed by the walk's own
    `elif size:` rather than by the revspec at all. The position that stood here — "one line down"
    — was wrong (it is three below the `size = int(...)` that feeds it) and is dropped rather than
    re-numbered, since a line count inside prose moves with the next edit above it. So the two
    branches are not a dichotomy — "resolves, and yields nothing" is a third outcome.

    UNREACHABLE HERE — and that is counted now rather than asserted, since a count in this very
    clause is what went wrong twice. `_publishable_copies` has FOUR direct call sites, not the
    "both" the retracted text claimed on both sides; three of them forward a `root` parameter, and
    every argument reaching those three in this suite is `REPO_ROOT` (3 calls) or the `clone`
    fixture's directory (18), while the fourth site passes `REPO_ROOT` itself. Both are working-tree
    tops. Measured at `269b4bc`, and re-derive rather than trust, since the digits move with any
    landing: the calls are the `_publishable_copies(` occurrences that are NOT the `def`, not the
    `GIT_CALL_MARKERS` entry and not prose, so a bare `grep -c` overcounts — this docstring is
    itself among the hits it would add. The number is not what makes the clause safe either; what
    makes it safe is that no caller supplies a non-top, and THAT is the thing to re-check. So the
    clause carries nothing today, in behaviour or in any pin, and the error ran in the
    CONSERVATIVE direction: the code is more robust than its own text was. It is corrected
    because "the walk requires a repository top", believed, invites either a guard nobody needs or
    a SECOND copy of the walk for another cwd — and a second copy is the exact failure
    `_publishable_copies` was assembled to prevent (its own docstring: the duplicate "would be the
    one nobody re-measured").

    "There is no such stage in an unconflicted index" was the first draft's reasoning, and it is
    FALSE: stage 0 is precisely the stage an unconflicted index has. So when the remainder after
    `0:` is ITSELF a tracked path, `cat-file` exits 0 and hands over THAT path's bytes under THIS
    path's name — no error, nothing skipped, a wrong answer. Measured, `cat-file -s :0:README.md`

    * `hidden` — a shaped `0:cred.json` beside a BENIGN tracked `cred.json`: the read returns

    NOT limited to stage 0, and this part is measured but deliberately UNPINNED: under a live `UU`

    for int() with base 10: ''`, thrown out of the generator ALL THREE gates on this walk drive —
    storage-state, text-artifact and, since VMCP-242 (819), magic-bytes.

    The state is REACHABLE rather than exotic, and the argument for that is weaker than an earlier
    draft's, which an independent pass disproved by reading the rulebook it cited. SKILL.md does
    mandate `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` before every push, and this repo's
    readiness criteria are `uv run pytest tests/unit` plus `ruff` — but the `&&` chain is NOT how a
    live conflict meets this suite, because SKILL.md says in as many words that a rebase conflict
    breaks the chain at `rebase`, so the gate never runs. What reaches it is the agent who then
    stands IN the conflict and runs the suite by hand while resolving — the ordinary thing to do
    while working out whether the merged tree is still correct. Narrower than "the gate crashes on
    every conflicted rebase", and enough: an agent debugging a conflict would meet a `ValueError`
    from a browser-isolation test with no relation to their card.

    It shipped correct and UNPINNED — and that is a claim about a TREE, so read the sha, not the
    date. RE-DERIVED here rather than taken from the card that filed it: on a throwaway clone at
    `653abb8`, the pre-VMCP-242 (819) shape of this walk, selection this file, `__pycache__` cleared
    and PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 — control collected=94, 0 failed; the guard replaced by `if True`
    collected=94, 0 failed. Nothing in the file caught it. It is no longer the
    only thing standing there: VMCP-242 (819) landed while this card was in flight, restructured the
    guard into the branch it is today and put its own pin,
    `test_a_tracked_candidate_whose_index_object_is_gone_is_reported`, across it — so on the current
    tree the branch's removal takes THREE rows, not two. That pin covers PREFIX mode and a deleted
    OBJECT; these two cover DEFAULT mode and a real `UU`, where nothing is yielded at all, which is
    the path all three shape gates take. Neither subsumes the other, and the honest reading is that
    the branch went from unpinned to redundantly pinned within one session.

# lines separately, with `collected` cross-checked against the control every time (120, all five
# rounds — so `-q` is not used, since it prints no `collected` line). Run four times over: on the
# first draft; after the second independent pass added the rc=0 rows; and twice more across the two
# rebases onto VMCP-242 (819), which rewrote the walk these reads live in and moved `collected`
# 105 -> 112 -> 118 -> 120. Only the numbers below are current; the earlier runs are named because
# a figure here belongs to a tree, and these ones moved.
# Control round: 0 failed, 0 errors.
#   * both reads back to `f":{rel}"` (the pre-820 body) -> 9 failed, 0 errors: the seven
#     first-component rows and both `THAT_EXISTS` rows
#   * only the SIZE read fixed, blob back to `f":{rel}"` -> 9 failed, the same nine
#   * only the BLOB read fixed, size back to `f":{rel}"` -> 7 failed: the seven, NOT the two
#   * the unresolvable-entry branch removed (`if sized.returncode != 0` -> `if False`) -> 3 failed:
#     the two conflict rows plus 819's `test_a_tracked_candidate_whose_index_object_is_gone_is_
#     reported`, which crosses the same branch from prefix mode
#
# That 9-against-7 is the measurement saying WHICH read matters WHERE, and an earlier draft of this
# record asserted the opposite — that the two half-fixes "cannot tell each other apart" — which was
# true only while the rc=0 rows did not exist yet. The `THAT_EXISTS` rows are the discriminator. On
# the rc=128 branch either bare read is fatal: a bare size read exits 128 and skips the path, a bare
# blob read exits 128 into `if blob.returncode == 0`, so all seven rows fall to both halves. On the
# rc=0 branch a bare size read merely reports ANOTHER path's SIZE, which changed no verdict on these
# two rows because the classifier reads the blob WHOLE — a bare size of 0, or one above
# `SHAPE_SCAN_MAX_BYTES`, would change it, and neither occurs on this stand. So those two fall only
# to a bare BLOB read. Both reads are fixed because between them they cover both branches.
#
# BOTH conflict rows die to the branch mutation, and that is stated rather than dressed up: the
# raise happens INSIDE the index half — `int("")` on the line right after it — so the WORKTREE half
# is never reached and the shaped row is not an independent detector of that mutation. ("Before
# either half" is what an earlier draft said, and the traceback disproves it.) It earns its place as
# a BOUND — without it, "the index half stays silent at `UU`" would read as a second silent miss
# beside the one this card fixes, and nothing in the file would say otherwise.
#
# THE REACHABILITY CLAIM GOT DEMONSTRATED BY ACCIDENT, and the accident is worth more than the
# argument it supports, so it is recorded with its inflation named. The `if False` round was first
# run in this worktree WHILE IT HELD AN UNRESOLVED CONFLICT of its own — the rebase onto 819 left
# `UU tests/unit/test_repo_browser_isolation.py` — and it came back **7 failed** rather than 3. The
# four extra rows are the ones that scan the REAL repository (`test_no_file_of_storage_state_shape_
# is_reachable_by_git` and its two siblings, plus the naive-grep comparison): with the branch gone,
# the tree's own conflicted path made `cat-file -s` fail and `int("")` took them all down. Control
# was 0 failed in that same tree, so the branch handled it — which is precisely the sentence
# `test_a_conflicted_entry_leaves_the_SCAN_STANDING` argues for, arrived at without being asked.
# It is NOT the number this record quotes: 7 belongs to a conflicted tree, 3 to a clean one, and
# the clean one is what ships. The lesson for the next sweep here is the mundane half — a round run
# mid-rebase measures the rebase too.
