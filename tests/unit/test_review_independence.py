"""#37 and #991: `require_review_independence` — the repo-toml flag that promotes "you do not
review your own work" from a convention to a GATE, and the ONE switch both surfaces now read.

#37 put the gate on `review_task`. #991 put the same flag on next_task's OFFER, which had been
skipping the caller's own cards unconditionally — so the two tools disagreed, next_task refusing
to offer what review_task would accept. Read this file as one flag with two halves; the second
half starts at its own banner below, with its own sweep record.

WHAT THIS FILE HAS TO PROTECT IS BOTH DIRECTIONS AT ONCE, and they pull opposite ways:

* OFF (the default, and what every consumer on `stable` runs today) the behaviour must be what
  it was before the gate existed — BOTH verdicts, the ownerless #705 bounce included. In a solo
  setup the missing authorship check is the CONDITION OF OPERATION, not a hole: one scoped token
  is the whole fleet, so implementer and reviewer are the SAME assignee and independence is
  carried by the agents' separated contexts. A gate that were on by default would refuse every
  review in this repo the moment it shipped.
* ON, a caller listed in the card's own assignees is refused, and refused BEFORE anything is
  written — the multi-identity hole this card was filed for, where the only thing standing
  between a self-approval and the `reviewed` label a human reads for Done is next_task's OFFER
  filter, which a direct call never consults.

Measured before the gate existed (both verdicts, on the fake): a verdict from the card's own
assignee was ACCEPTED, `approve` landing `reviewed` with the card left in Review. That is the
behaviour the OFF tests below keep and the ON tests refuse.

MUTATION SWEEP, run in a separate `git clone --no-hardlinks` with `__pycache__` cleared and
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1, `vikunja_mcp.__file__` printed every round and resolving inside the
clone, ONE selection throughout (this file + test_config.py + test_workflow_gates.py), `-q`
dropped so `collected` is printed, and each round read by COUNTING lines beginning `FAILED ` and
`ERROR ` separately rather than by the first `N failed` in stdout: control (opening) 0 failed, 0
errors, collected 170; deleting the gate's CALL SITE from `review_task` -> 6 failed, 0 errors,
collected 170; gutting the gate BODY so it always returns, call site intact -> 6 failed, 0
errors, collected 170; flipping the config default to True -> 4 failed, 0 errors, collected 170
(one of them `test_reads_repo_toml_and_env_token`, honest collateral — it compares a whole
`Config` against defaults); ALSO reading the flag from the env layers -> 2 failed, 0 errors,
collected 170; reading raw board assignees instead of the stale-tolerant helper -> 1 failed, 0
errors, collected 170, and that ONE is the #885 blackout test, which is the only thing standing
between this gate and a bypass on the exact shape where next_task's offer filter is gone too;
moving the gate to AFTER the approve verdict is written -> 3 failed, 0 errors, collected 170;
control (closing, restored) 0 failed, 0 errors, collected 170, clone clean. Collected is equal
in every round, so each number is a delta against the control and not a different selection.
